SIMANDLE, District Judge: 
INTRODUCTION 
 
This is a personal injury case with allegations of a 
 
defective climbing harness manufactured or sold by Defendants. 
This matter is before the Court on the motion of Defendant 
Thompson Manufacturing (“Defendant,” “Thompson” or “TMI”) to 
dismiss Plaintiffs Nicholas Kuhar (“Kuhar” or “Plaintiff”) and 
Julie Kuhar’s (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) Second Amended 
Complaint [Docket Item 103] for lack of personal jurisdiction 
over TMI. [Docket Item 128.] This motion renews TMI’s previous 
motion [Docket Item 56], which the Court previously denied 
without prejudice before allowing jurisdictional discovery 
[Docket Items 84 & 85], which has now been completed. Defendant 
Petzl America (“Petzl”) submitted a response brief in opposition 
[Docket Item 142], in which Plaintiffs joined [Docket Item 144]. 
TMI submitted a reply [Docket Item 145], as well as a letter 
alerting the Court to supplementary authority [Docket Item 168], 
to which Petzl responded [Docket Item 177]. For the reasons set 
forth below the Court will GRANTxxx the motion to dismiss.  
 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 3 of 38 PageID: 4088
 BACKGROUND 
As the Court has previously stated, “[o]n December 24, 
 
2013, Plaintiff Nicholas Kuhar was cleaning gutters at a house 
in Alloway when the ‘Micrograb’ wire core flip-line safety 
harness with which he had secured himself failed, causing him to 
fall thirty-seven feet onto the concrete below[,]” whereupon he 
sustained several serious injuries. [Docket Item 84 at 2.] 
 
The Second Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff was an 
end-user who was injured by a defective “safety harness” 
containing a “carabiner” (also referred to as a “rope-grab” or 
the “MicroGrab” in the briefing [Docket Item 128-3 at 6 n.3]) 
that was “manufactured, designed, produced, advertised, 
promoted, sold, distributed and otherwise introduced into the 
stream of commerce by the specifically named defendants.” 
[Docket Item 103 at 1 ¶ 1.] Plaintiffs allege that the safety 
harness “failed to prevent personal injury to its user through a 
defective carabiner and bolt; [f]ailed to adequately warn its 
user of the dangers inherent with the safety harness; [f]ailed 
to adequately warn its user of the risks involved with using the 
safety harness; and [o]therwise completely failed to perform in 
the manner as advertised.” Id. at 1-4 ¶¶ 2-9 (allegations 
referred to collectively as “the Defects”). With regard to TMI 
specifically, Plaintiffs allege that TMI “advertised, promoted, 
sold, distributed, and otherwise introduced into the stream of 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 4 of 38 PageID: 4089
commerce the safety harness. . . . including all of its 
components[.]” Id. at 2 ¶ 5.  
 
The Second Amended Complaint also states that TMI is “a 
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State 
of Utah, with its principal place of business located in 
Clearfield, Utah.” Id. at 4 ¶ 8.  
 
As the Court previously stated in its Opinion denying 
without prejudice TMI’s earlier motion to dismiss pursuant to 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2): 
[TMI] produced and sold a component part to [Petzl] 
that was allegedly used [in] the Petzl Micrograb 
device that is the subject of the present lawsuit. TMI 
was incorporated in and maintains its principal place 
of business in the State of Utah, where its corporate 
offices and manufacturing facilities are also located. 
TMI’s President, Travis Lane, affirms that TMI does 
not own, rent, lease, occupy or maintain any property 
in the State of New Jersey; does not employ anyone or 
conduct any operations in the State of New Jersey; 
does not sell, advertise, market or deliver its 
products to, or derive revenue from sales of its 
products from, the State of New Jersey; has not paid 
income, property or any other tax to the State of New 
Jersey, nor is it registered or licensed to conduct 
business in the state, nor has it authorized anyone to 
act as its agent in the state; and does not and has 
never obtained banking, accounting or legal services 
from companies located in the State of New Jersey. 
 
[Docket Item 84 at 6-7 (internal citations omitted).] The Court 
also noted Plaintiffs’ and Petzl’s contentions (and supportive 
documentation) that  
a related company, Rock Exotica, sells similar or 
identical products in the State of New Jersey, and 
that therefore TMI must be aware that its products are 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 5 of 38 PageID: 4090
incorporated into devices that are sold in New 
Jersey[;] . . . that the climbing devices shown on 
Rock Exotica’s website . . . are the same as those 
purchased by Petzl from TMI[;] . . . that Rock 
Exotica’s website directs consumers to two authorized 
dealerships in New Jersey where they can purchase Rock 
Exotica products[;] . . . that TMI and Rock Exotica 
share a founder and owner, Rock Thompson[;] . . . that 
the two companies’ manufacturing facilities appear to 
be located at the same Freeport Center in Clearfield, 
Utah[;] . . . that the two companies apparently share 
a phone number and website[;] . . . and that a number 
of employees represent online that they are affiliated 
with both companies[.] 
 
[Docket Item 84 at 7-8 (internal citations omitted).] 
 
The parties, having completed jurisdictional discovery 
[Docket Item 128-3 at 11 n.5], allege the following additional 
relevant facts1:  
 
The item Plaintiff bought in New Jersey was purchased from 
Defendant Bailey’s in January of 2006, and was a “flipline kit” 
consisting of “several components: 1) a wire core 
flipline/lanyard (i.e., a rope with a core made of wire); 2) an 
oval screw link; and 3) a Petzl rope grab.” [Docket Item 128-3 
at 8, 6.] The rope grab contains a spring-loaded cam, which 
(when not under pressure from the tension of an arborist’s body 
weight) “rotates on an ‘axle’ consisting of a nut and shoulder 
bolt. Plaintiffs here claim the shoulder bolt fractured, 
                     
1 The factual allegations stated herein are supported, if not 
otherwise noted, by appropriate citations to the record 
developed during jurisdictional discovery and attached as 
exhibits to the motions and papers presently before the Court. 
Those citations are largely omitted from this Opinion. 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 6 of 38 PageID: 4091
apparently causing the flipline to lose tension and allowing Mr. 
Kuhar to fall.” Id. at 7-8. Bailey’s put together the kit by 
compiling the separate components and marketing the combination 
“as a Bailey’s flipline kit.” Id. at 8. Bailey’s purchased the 
rope grab from Defendant Petzl America. Id. Petzl America 
“obtained [the rope grab] from TMI, who assembled it at Petzl 
America’s request. . . . TMI manufactured the body and the cam 
of the Micrograb. TMI did not manufacture the shoulder screw or 
bolt that allegedly fractured or the nut that secured it. 
Rather, TMI purchased the nut and bolt as finished products from 
co-defendant Uintah Fastener & Supply[.]” Id. (internal 
citations omitted).  
 
With regard to TMI itself, TMI states: 
 
Since its inception in 1991, TMI has maintained 
and still maintains its principal place of business in 
Utah. TMI’s corporate offices and manufacturing 
facilities are located in Utah. TMI never had offices, 
manufacturing facilities or places of business within 
New Jersey. It never owned, leased, rented, occupied 
or maintained any real property within New Jersey. It 
has never maintained a telephone listing or post 
office box within New Jersey. In short, TMI has never 
had any physical connection to the State of New 
Jersey. 
 
TMI has never employed anyone within New Jersey. 
TMI has never sold products to customers in New 
Jersey. It has never had distributors within the state 
and has never delivered products to or within New 
Jersey. TMI has never derived revenue from sales to 
customers located in New Jersey. TMI has never 
advertised or marketed in, nor has it directed any 
advertising or marketing towards, New Jersey 
residents. TMI has never entered into any contracts in 
New Jersey. TMI has never exercised any control over 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 7 of 38 PageID: 4092
any person, firm or corporation located within the 
state. 
 
TMI may have purchased aluminum on two occasions 
in 2013-4 from a metals broker who had an address in 
New Jersey but may have been physically located in 
Europe. Other than those two transactions and the 
possibility that products purchased from websites like 
Amazon or McMaster have unknown origins that 
conceivably could have included New Jersey, TMI has 
never even sourced or purchased materials for its 
business from companies located in New Jersey. 
 
[Docket Item 128-3 at 12-14.] TMI also again alleges that it has 
never had any financial or legal relationships with the State of 
New Jersey or any person or entity residing in New Jersey. Id. 
at 14.  
 
In its Motion, TMI describes its “[c]orporate [h]istory and 
[r]elationship [w]ith Rock Exotica, LLC” as follows: 
 
TMI was incorporated in 1991 pursuant to the laws 
of the State of Utah. A Petzl-related entity called 
Spirit of St. Luis was TMI’s original majority 
shareholder. TMI was formed to be a contract 
manufacturer for Petzl France[] and its American 
distributor. TMI remained an exclusive contract 
manufacturer for Petzl France and its American 
distributor until 2002-[0]3. In approximately 1998, 
TMI began manufacturing rope grabs for Petzl. The 
Micrograb was one of the rope grabs TMI manufactured 
exclusively for Petzl.  
 
In 2002-[0]3, Rock Thompson purchased the 
outstanding shares of TMI and became the sole 
shareholder. TMI remained a contract manufacturer for 
Petzl but also began to act as a contract manufacturer 
for other customers. TMI has never and does not sell 
any products to end users. It does not own any 
intellectual property.  
 
Mr. Thompson remained the sole shareholder until 
TMI’s stock was purchased by Rock Exotica, LLC when it 
came into existence on December 24, 2012. Through that 
transaction, TMI became a wholly owned subsidiary of 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 8 of 38 PageID: 4093
Rock Exotica, LLC. TMI remains a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Rock Exotica, LLC today. 
 
Id. at 14-15. 
 
The nature of the relationship between parent corporation 
Rock Exotica and subsidiary TMI is the subject of much dispute 
between the parties. As noted below, at the time of Plaintiff’s 
purchase of this equipment in January, 2006, TMI and its related 
corporation, Rock Exotica Equipment, LLC, existed. Later, Rock 
Exotica Equipment was merged into a new entity, Rock Exotica, 
LLC, in 2012. For general jurisdiction, the activities of TMI 
and Rock Exotica Equipment, LLC and Rock Exotica, LLC (and 
whether TMI is the alter ego of either or both entities) will be 
relevant. For specific jurisdiction, on the other hand, the 
activities of TMI and Rock Exotica Equipment, LLC, pertaining to 
the 2006 sale of the climbing harness to Mr. Kuhar in New Jersey 
will be relevant, as Rock Exotica, LLC, did not exist in 2006. 
As Rock Exotica Equipment’s successor, however, Rock Exotica may 
be liable to the same extent as Rock Exotica Equipment would 
have been. 
 
TMI depicts two companies that share certain commonalities 
(as discussed supra and in the Court’s earlier Opinion) but are, 
in the main, separate: Rock Exotica (unlike TMI) has no 
employees, id. at 15; unlike TMI, Rock Exotica “does not 
manufacture products” but rather “is a marketing and 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 9 of 38 PageID: 4094
distribution company for products used in the fall protection 
industry[,]” id., and “markets its products to smaller non-
exclusive distributors” of such products, with 1-3 of its 
distributors (since 2012) being located in New Jersey, although 
it “does not have dealership or financing agreements with any 
distributor of its products[,]” including the New Jersey 
distributors. Id. at 15-16. TMI asserts that Rock Exotica, LLC 
and TMI “run their business [sic] separately and keep completely 
separate books. . . . TMI has customers other than Rock Exotica, 
LLC and Rock Exotica, LLC sources products from vendors other 
than TMI”2; the two companies use their own separate enterprise 
computer systems. Id. at 16. Sales and purchase transactions 
between the two companies are logged and put into effect without 
                     
2 Of the two citations to the evidentiary record in support of 
the contention that Rock Exotica, LLC sources products from 
vendors other than TMI (namely, Exhibit M, Docket Item 128-17, 
at 10-11; and Exhibit O, Docket Item 128-19, apparently in its 
entirety), the Court notes that one does not discuss Rock 
Exotica, LLC’s product sourcing, and the other contains only a 
conclusory statement to that effect in TMI’s responses to 
interrogatories. The Court notes that TMI, in its Reply, again 
asserts that it sells its products to Rock Exotica, LLC; Petzl 
America; and MSA; and that Rock Exotica “likewise sources its 
products from other entities.” [Docket Item 145 at 11.] Again, 
however, the Court has carefully scrutinized the citations to 
the record that TMI provided in support of the latter part of 
that assertion, i.e., that Rock Exotica offers for sale products 
not manufactured by TMI and does not find evidence in the record 
to support that beyond TMI’s response to initial interrogatories 
stating, “Rock Exotica LLC is a marketing and distribution 
company that, among other things, purchases products and 
services in arms-length transactions from various sources, one 
of which is TMI.” [Docket Item 128-19 at 4.] 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 10 of 38 PageID: 4095
special consideration that the seller/buyer is one with which 
there is a corporate relationship rather than an unrelated 
seller/buyer. Id.  
 
TMI notes that, while it is TMI employees who provide 
“various administrative services to Rock Exotica, LLC” (as, 
again, Rock Exotica, LLC has no employees of its own), this 
occurs “pursuant to an administrative services agreement” that 
TMI characterizes as “unwritten but arms-length[,]” covering 12 
TMI employees at present, who accordingly devote “a portion of 
[their] work time” to “serve [the] marketing and distribution 
business” needs of Rock Exotica, LLC, (e.g., accounting, 
creating sales orders and invoices, and shipping activities). 
Id. at 17. In exchange for these services, Rock Exotica, LLC 
“makes monthly payments to TMI[,]” the amount of which “is 
adjusted on an annual basis and is calculated based on the 
number and nature of the individuals whose services are needed, 
their roles and responsibilities, and the amount of their time 
needed by TMI [sic]3.” Id. at 17-18. 
 
Petzl [Docket Item 142 at 8-18] and Plaintiffs [Docket Item 
144] depict the relationship between Rock Exotica, LLC and TMI

conflict or desire of the speaker.’ Redden and Beyer, Modern 
Dictionary for the Legal Profession (2d ed. 1996).”).

differently. They point to the following facts in support of 
finding that the two companies are alter egos: 
• “The president of TMI, Travis Lane, who is also an owner of 
Rock Exotica, testified that the products TMI manufactures 
for Rock Exotica are marketed in New Jersey. . . . [and] 
that Rock Exotica has [two] authorized dealers who sell the 
TMI[-]manufactured products in New Jersey” as well as the 
Rock Exotica website, which “sells climbing products 
nationwide, including into New Jersey,” in contrast to TMI, 
which has no website [Docket Item 142 at 11, 13]; 
• “Rock Exotica LLC is owned by Rock Thompson (20%) and JPL 
[I]ndustries (80%). Rock Exotica owns 100% of TMI” such 
that the two corporations therefore “have common 
ownership[,]” and “the business decisions for both 
companies are made by the same three people[:] . . . Travis 
Lane, Brandon Lane and Rock Thompson.” id. at 11-12; 
• “Rock Exotica Equipment, LLC was merged into Rock Exotica, 
LLC in 2012, however both entities traded/trade as ‘Rock 
Exotica,’” and one or the other entity, using that as its 
trade name, “has been selling products for 28 years, which 
includes the early 2006 time period when the subject 
Micrograb was sold” and “at all times relevant to this 
case[,]” id.4; 
• “Rock Exotica has no employees. All work of Rock Exotica is 
performed by TMI employees” who “are issued a paycheck by 
TMI” for this work; moreover, “TMI employees even determine 
what type [of] work should be done for Rock Exotica” 
including “having a TMI employee determine whether Rock 
Exotica needs to have TMI manufacture more products to sell 
under the Rock Exotica name[,]”; Petzl argues that “Rock 
Exotica exists only through the actions of TMI employees 
who are paid via TMI paycheck for the work. . . . In this 
regard TMI exerts so much control over Rock Exotica that 
Rock Exotica does not meaningfully exist as a separate 
entity . . . [because it] acts . . . exclusively through 
TMI employees,” id. at 12; 
• Travis “Lane, who is president of TMI and denies any 
employment relationship with Rock Exotica, refers to Rock 
Exotica as ‘us’ when describing [Rock Exotica’s] sales 
                     
4 Petzl argues that “TMI’s argument that Rock Exotica did not 
exist until 2012 is incorrect. Rather Rock Exotica LLC, formed 
in 2012, merged with the existing Rock Exotica brand, which has 
existed continuously for 28 years.” Id. at 12.

process [to a New Jersey customer or authorized dealer,]” 
id. at 13, citing Lane Dep., Docket Item 128-17, at 35 
(“They call us up. And they say we would like to buy your 
product” (emphasis added)); refers to the Rock Exotica 
website as “our website”; and has an email address ending 
in “@rockexotica.com” [Docket Item 142 at 13]; 
• TMI sells its products “to only three customers: Petzl 
America, MSA, and Rock Exotica” with less than 1% going to 
MSA, 5% going to Petzl America, and the remainder going to 
(or “through,” id.) Rock Exotica, “showing that Rock 
Exotica is a mere conduit for TMI to sell the products it 
manufacture[s,]” id.; 
• When asked, if Rock Exotica, LLC has no employees but still 
places orders for items with TMI for TMI to manufacture, 
who exactly it is that “the orders from [Rock Exotica] come 
from,” Lane answered as follows: 
 
So, the orders come from the customers of 
Rock Exotica. So, we carry an inventory. Say 
we might have a hundred products at Rock 
Exotica. And so, the customers of Rock 
Exotica will come in, and they’ll place 
orders for it. And, you know, you sell out 
your inventory, then you know that 
automatically triggers you that you need to 
make more.  
 
So, we have a shipping individual that works 
for Thompson Manufacturing. And he’ll 
recognize that. And he’ll say to the person 
responsible for placing the orders, you 
know, look. We are out. We need to get some 
more. Can you order some more from Thompson 
for us. 
 
 [Docket Item 128-17 at 14]. Mr. Lane added that a Rock 
Exotica customer will, for instance, place an order on the 
Rock Exotica website, but the employee who processes that 
order will be a TMI employee working for Rock Exotica, LLC 
under the administrative services agreement, id. at 15; 
• The two corporations “are insured under one insurance 
policy” with TMI paying Rock Exotica’s premium for that 
policy and TMI “also pay[ing] the lease for the space where 
Rock Exotica exists, to the extent a company with no 
employees can be said to occupy a space[,]” [Docket Item 
142 at 13-14]; 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 13 of 38 PageID: 4098
• Although Travis Lane “testified that TMI would ‘ship’ 
products to Rock Exotica, . . . he later admitted that 
there is no ‘shipping’, the product is just moved within 
the warehouse [where TMI simply stores the products TMI 
manufactures bearing the Rock Exotica trade name] (by a TMI 
employee) and shipped to the purchaser (also by a TMI 
employee)[,]” id. at 14; 
• With regard to the alleged “unwritten but arms-length 
administrative services agreement,” for which Rock Exotica 
apparently pays TMI $90,000 a month, “TMI does not even 
bill Rock Exotica for the alleged ‘administrative 
services’[,]” perhaps because “TMI and Rock Exotica do not 
track the work TMI employees perform on behalf of Rock 
Exotica. Rather, a TMI employee with access to Rock Exotica 
funds transfers funds from Rock Exotica to TMI[,]” id., and 
that Travis Lane described the “alleged ‘arm’s length’ 
agreement as follows: 
 
Q: Okay. So, going back to the administrative 
services agreement, can you tell me what the 
terms of that agreement are? 
A: The terms of the agreement are that Rock 
Exotica will pay for any services performed by a 
Thompson Manufacturing employee.  
Q: Are there any other terms or conditions that 
you are aware of? 
A: No. 
 
(citing Lane Dep. At 17:3-11), id.)5; 
 
                     
5 Petzl further argues that Lane’s testimony about the amount of 
time TMI employees devote to performing “administrative 
services” for Rock Exotica is not credible. Id. at 15. In his 
deposition, Lane testified that, pursuant to the agreement, 
twelve TMI employees spend between 10 and 60% of their work-
weeks doing work for Rock Exotica, with only “three actually 
devoting up to 60% of their time.” Id. Petzl submits that, even 
if all twelve worked 60% of their time for Rock Exotica, “this 
arrangement would mean that Rock Exotica is paying 
administrative workers at a rate of $150,000 per year, each 
[given a monthly rate of $90,000],” and submits that, given that 
most of the twelve TMI employees do not devote 60% of their 
weeks to Rock Exotica, the annual rate that Rock Exotica pays 
TMI per administrative worker is even higher. Id. at 15, 15 
nn.13-14. Petzl submits that Lane’s testimony that Rock Exotica 
is “a small company” that cannot afford to hire its own 
employees is belied by its “outlay of over a million dollars a 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 14 of 38 PageID: 4099
• “[T]here is no separation or distinction for TMI workers 
doing work for Rock Exotica. The TMI employees do not 
account for time spent doing Rock Exotica work. Mr. Lane 
even admitted that Rock Exotica pays the same amount to TMI 
each month regardless of how much or little work was done 
by TMI employees for Rock Exotica in that month[,]” and 
that TMI employees do work for Rock Exotica in “the same 
location[,]” at the direction of their TMI-employed 
managers, id. at 16; 
• “Mr. Lane’s testimony indicates he views these companies as 
one and the same[,]” given instances in his testimony 
described above, and his repeated use of the word “we” when 
discussing the business operations of Rock Exotica6 
(although he denied employment with Rock Exotica and was 
produced for his deposition “pursuant to a Fed. R. Civ. P. 
30(b)(6) deposition notice” to TMI), and explicitly 
described “pooling resources,” id. at 17-18. 
• As far as the specific MicroGrab at issue in this case, TMI 
asserts that it assembled it and sold it in Utah “to co-
defendant Petzl America” and delivered it to Petzl America 
in Utah in November of 2005, before it passed from Petzl 
America to Bailey’s, where it was subsequently incorporated 
into the flipline kit Plaintiff bought. [Docket Item 128-3 
at 18.] TMI states:  
 
                     
year, purportedly for warehouse/administrative work.” Id. at 15-
16.  
 
TMI disputes that Petzl’s calculations about the rate of 
pay it collects for the administrative services agreement with 
Rock Exotica, LLC (and its urged conclusion that the high rate 
of pay should militate in favor of a finding that no such 
agreement actually exists) constitute “evidence” that would 
support a finding that the corporations are alter egos: 
“Examining counsel’s calculation of the value of the services 
rendered or investigating whether Rock Exotica LLC is getting 
fair value might be an interesting exercise. But the exercise 
merely underscores that Rock Exotica LLC does pay for the 
services it obtains. In other words, the evidence proves the 
companies do observe corporate formalities and distinctions.” 
[Docket Item 145 at 10.] 
6 See, e.g. Lane Dep., Docket Item 128-17 at 12 (“Q: How does an 
employee know when they need to do services for Rock Exotica, 
LLC, an employee of Thompson Manufacturing know? A: So, we keep 
two separate books. And we have two separate ERP systems . . . 
.”). 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 15 of 38 PageID: 4100
After delivery, TMI would have no contact with or 
control over any relevant part or product. TMI 
had no control over to whom or where Petzl 
America may have sold or shipped products it 
owned. TMI knew that Petzl America was in the 
business of selling products throughout the 
United States, but there is no evidence TMI had 
any more specific knowledge of Petzl’s customer 
base or their location. 
Id. (internal citations omitted).  
 
The parties, as shown above, have devoted much attention 
 
and effort to the relationships between TMI and Rock Exotica, 
LLC, its parent since 2012. This will indeed be relevant to 
assessing whether general jurisdiction may be asserted as to TMI 
when the complaint herein was filed in 2016. Almost nothing has 
been discovered as to the Rock Exotica Equipment entity that 
existed in 2006, when Plaintiff purchased the equipment by mail 
order in New Jersey, which is the connection relevant to 
specific jurisdiction arising from the 2006 purchase. It appears 
that TMI manufactured and sold its Micrograb component to Petzl 
in a Utah transaction in November, 2005, without going through 
Rock Exotica Equipment. Defendant Petzl America is alleged to be 
a wholly-owned subsidiary corporation of Petzl Company, a 
limited liability corporation of the French Republic, with its 
principal place of business in Crolles, France. Petzl America is 
alleged to have its principal place of business in West Valley 
City, Utah. (Second Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 3 & 4.) Petzl America 
distributed the equipment to Defendant Bailey’s Corporation, a 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 16 of 38 PageID: 4101
California corporation with its principal place of business in 
Woodland, California. (Id. ¶ 5.) TMI’s Micrograb was 
incorporated by Bailey’s into the flipline kit, which Bailey’s 
sold to Mr. Kuhar by mail order shipped to Bridgeton, New 
Jersey, in 2006. It does not appear from these facts that either 
Rock Exotica Equipment or TMI had any connection to New Jersey 
in the 2006 transaction of the allegedly defective flipline kit, 
as discussed below. [Bailey’s Invoice, Jan. 18, 2006, at Toomey 
Decl, Ex. C (Docket Item 128-7).] 
 
 
 STANDARD OF REVIEW 
To defeat a motion to dismiss for lack of personal 
 
jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., “the 
plaintiff bears the burden of establishing with reasonable 
particularity sufficient contacts between the defendant and the 
forum state to support jurisdiction.” Provident Nat. Bank v. 
Cal. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 819 F.2d 434, 437 (3d Cir. 1987). 
Ultimately, to meet its burden to demonstrate that the exercise 
of jurisdiction over the parties would be proper, the plaintiff 
must proffer evidence of jurisdiction through sworn affidavits 
or other competent documents. See Metcalfe v. Renaissance

 DISCUSSION 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e) allows a district 
 
court to assert personal jurisdiction over a non-resident 
defendant to the extent permitted by the law of the state where 
the district court sits. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e). New Jersey law 
permits the exercise of jurisdiction to the extent allowed by 
the Constitution, making the current inquiry whether the Court 
can exercise jurisdiction without offending the Due Process 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 18 of 38 PageID: 4103
Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Miller Yacht Sales, Inc. v. 
Smith, 384 F.3d 93, 97 (3d Cir. 2004).  
 
The Due Process clause requires that Plaintiff establish 
that the Corporate Defendants have “certain minimum contacts 
with [New Jersey] such that the maintenance of the suit does not 
offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial 
justice.” Int’l Shoe v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945); 
Pinker v. Roche Holdings Ltd., 292 F.3d 361, 368 (3d Cir. 2002). 
A plaintiff must establish either that “the cause of action 
arose from the defendant’s forum-related activities (specific 
jurisdiction) or that the defendant has ‘continuous and 
systematic’ contacts with the forum state (general 
jurisdiction).” Mellon Bank (EAST) v. DiVeronica Bros., 983 F.2d 
551, 554 (3d Cir. 1993).   
 
The Court reiterates its earlier discussion of personal 
jurisdiction in the Opinion of June 9, 2017 [Docket Item 84]: 
The personal jurisdiction inquiry traditionally 
requires an examination of whether its exercise over a 
defendant is permissible under both the state’s long-
arm statute and the Due Process Clause of the 
Constitution. But if the state’s personal jurisdiction 
statute permits the exercise of jurisdiction to the 
fullest limits of due process, as is the case here in 
New Jersey, the two jurisdictional inquiries in this 
case collapse into one: whether the exercise of 
jurisdiction comports with due process. Imo Indus., 
Inc. v. Kiekert AG, 155 F.3d 254, 259 (3d Cir. 1998); 
DeJames v. Magnificence Carriers, Inc., 654 F.2d 280, 
284 (3d Cir. 1981). 
 
As has often been repeated, the Due Process 
Clause of the Constitution permits the exercise of 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 19 of 38 PageID: 4104
personal jurisdiction when there are “minimum 
contacts” between a non-resident defendant and the 
forum state such that “maintenance of the suit does 
not offend traditional notions of fair play and 
substantial justice.” J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. V. 
Nicastro, 131 S. Ct. 2780, 2787 (2011) (quoting Int’l 
Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)). A 
court may exercise either general jurisdiction or 
specific jurisdiction over a defendant as long as it 
is consistent with that principle. General 
jurisdiction may be asserted over a foreign 
corporation even when the cause of action has no 
relation to those contacts if the defendant’s contacts 
with the forum are so “continuous and systematic” as 
to render them essentially “at home” in the forum 
state. Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746, 754 
(2014); Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. 
Brown, 131 S. Ct. 2846, 2851 (2011); Helicopteros 
Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 
414 (1984). If an out-of-state defendant’s contacts 
with the forum are insufficiently substantial to 
establish general jurisdiction, a court may still 
assert specific jurisdiction if the suit “aris[es] out 
of or relate[s] to the defendant’s contacts with the 
forum.” Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 414, n.8. The 
inquiry here becomes whether the defendant has 
“purposefully directed” his activities at residents in 
the forum state, Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 
U.S. 462, 472 (1985), or whether there was “some act 
by which the defendant purposefully avail[ed] itself 
of the privilege of conducting activities within the 
forum State, thus invoking the benefits and 
protections of its laws.” Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 
235, 253 (1958). 
 
[Docket Item 84 at 4-6.] To assert specific jurisdiction a 
plaintiff must establish that (1) the defendants “purposely 
directed [their] activities at New Jersey; (2) the 
litigation “arise[s] out of or relate[s] to” at least one 
of the defendants’ activities in New Jersey; and (3) the 
exercise of jurisdiction comports with traditional notions 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 20 of 38 PageID: 4105
of “fair play and substantial justice.” O’Connor, 496 F.3d 
at 316 (citing Burger King, 471 U.S. at 472). 
 
The Court continues to adhere to its previously-stated 
position that Plaintiffs have not carried their burden to 
establish that New Jersey would have general jurisdiction 
over TMI directly. [Docket Item 84 at 7-8.] The Court 
previously granted jurisdictional discovery with regard to 
the question of whether New Jersey would have specific 
jurisdiction over TMI. Id. at 8-11. 
 
As the Court previously stated: 
Even where a corporation does not come into direct 
contact with the forum state, “minimum contacts” may 
exist and specific jurisdiction may lie where the 
corporation “delivers its products into the stream of 
[commerce] with the expectation that they will be 
purchased by consumers in the forum state.” World-Wide 
Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 298. In the absence of a clear 
directive as to what level of engagement the 
corporation must have with the forum state in order to 
rise to the level of constitutionally adequate 
“minimum contacts” under the stream of commerce 
theory, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals instructs 
courts to consider the standards enunciated in the 
plurality opinions by Justices O’Connor and Brennan in 
Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102  
(1987). See Pennzoil Prods. Co. v. Colelli & Assocs., 
Inc., 149 F.3d 197, 205 (3d Cir. 1998). In practice, 
this means that courts first look for “the placement 
of a product into the stream of commerce . . . 
accompanied by some additional conduct of the 
defendant that may indicate an intent or purpose to 
serve the market in the forum State,” such as 
“designing the product for the market in the forum 
State . . . [or] establishing channels for providing 
regular service to customers in the forum State.” 
Pennzoil, 149 F.3d at 206 (citing Asahi Metal, 480 
U.S. at 112 (O’Connor, J.)). In the alternative, 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 21 of 38 PageID: 4106
courts then apply Justice Brennan’s standard, which 
finds minimum contacts where the “defendant . . . has 
placed goods in the stream of commerce [and] benefits 
economically from the retail sale of the final product 
in the forum State, and indirectly benefits from the 
State’s laws that regulate and facilitate commercial 
activity.” Pennzoil, 149 F.3d at 207 (citing Asahi 
Metal, 480 U.S. at 117 (Brennan, J., concurring)).  
 
[Docket Item 84 at 8-9.] 
 
The parties have pointed the Court’s attention toward the 
recent case of Shuker v. Smith and Nephew, PLC, 885 F.3d 760 (3d 
Cir. 2018) [Docket Items 168 & 177]. In that case, the Third 
Circuit discussed the “stream of commerce theory” of specific 
personal jurisdiction, defining it as a theory finding specific 
personal jurisdiction “over a non-resident defendant when that 
defendant ‘has injected its goods into the forum state 
indirectly via the so-called stream of commerce,’ rendering it 
foreseeable that one of the defendant’s goods could cause injury 
in the forum state.” Shuker, 885 F.3d at 780 (citing D’Jamoos ex 
rel. Estate of Weingeroff v. Pilatus Aircraft Ltd., 566 F.3d 94, 
104 (3d Cir. 2009)).  
 
Looking at the recent and less-recent Supreme Court 
precedents of J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 
877-85 (2011)(plurality opinion) and Asahi Metal, 480 U.S. at 
108-13 (plurality opinion), the Third Circuit stated: 
A plurality of Supreme Court Justices has twice 
rejected the stream-of-commerce theory . . . stating, 
in a manner consistent with our own case law, that 
plaintiffs must instead rely on ‘some act by which the 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 22 of 38 PageID: 4107
defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege 
of conducting activities within the forum State, thus 
invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,’ 
Asahi, 480 U.S. at 109; see D’Jamoos, 566 F.3d at 102-
03. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recently held that 
“[t]he bare fact that [a non-resident defendant] 
contracted with a [resident] distributor is not enough 
to establish personal jurisdiction in the State.” 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court, --- U.S. -
--, 137 S.Ct. 1773, 1783 (2017). We thus have no cause 
to revisit our Court’s precedent on this issue, and we 
decline to adopt the Shukers’ stream-of-commerce 
theory of specific personal jurisdiction. 
 
Shuker, 885 F.3d at 780. The Court went on to hold that the 
allegations that the defendant undertook efforts “to exploit a 
national market” that “necessarily included Pennsylvania” were 
insufficient to establish “our Circuit’s requirement of 
purposeful availment: ‘what is necessary is a deliberate 
targeting of the forum,’ O’Connor, 496 F.3d at 317[.]” Shuker, 
885 F.3d at 780. 
 
However, the court in Shuker went on to order 
jurisdictional discovery on an “alter ego” theory of personal 
jurisdiction where the plaintiffs’ “allegations” “suffice[d] to 
make a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction” in that 
they 
paint[ed] a plausible picture of control by PLC over 
Smith & Nephew: the two companies’ decisionmaking is 
integrated, PLC has authority over Smith & Nephew’s 
strategic business decisions, PLC pays for the 
development of Smith & Nephew’s products, and 
executives from both companies work together to make 
decisions regarding Smith & Nephew’s hip systems, as 
shown in a 2012 Smith & Nephew press release that 
directed investor and media inquiries not to Smith & 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 23 of 38 PageID: 4108
Nephew employees, but to PLC executives. Given that no 
party disputes that personal jurisdiction exists over 
Smith & Nephew as PLC’s subsidiary in Pennsylvania, 
the Shukers’ allegations, taken as true and in 
isolation, would suffice to show that PLC controlled 
Smith & Nephew, that Smith & Nephew was PLC’s agent, 
and that personal jurisdiction must exist over both 
Smith & Nephew and PLC in Pennsylvania.  
 
Shuker, 885 F.3d at 781. Recognizing that many of these facts 
were in dispute, the Third Circuit remanded for jurisdictional 
discovery and stated that, “[i]f evidence adduced from such 
discovery supports the conclusion that personal jurisdiction is 
proper as to PLC, then the Shukers may seek leave under Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) to amend their Third Amended 
Complaint to join PLC as a co-defendant.” Id. at 782 n.21.  
 
Similarly, this Court previously ordered jurisdictional 
discovery because Plaintiffs and Petzl adduced evidence 
“connecting Defendant TMI with non-party Rock Exotica”: namely, 
“that the parties share a founder, a phone number, and a 
website, appear to be located at the same place, and may share 
employees and common ownership[.]” [Docket Item 84 at 9-10.] The 
Court cautioned that this was “not enough to establish personal 
jurisdiction over TMI by a preponderance of the evidence, even 
if there would be enough evidence of connections with the state 
of New Jersey to establish personal jurisdiction over Rock 
Exotica[,]” id. at 10, even where Petzl and Plaintiffs adduced 
evidence showing that “Rock Exotica[] sells similar or identical 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 24 of 38 PageID: 4109
products in the State of New Jersey, and that therefore TMI must 
be aware that its products are incorporated into devices that 
are sold in New Jersey” where “the climbing devices shown on 
Rock Exotica’s website . . . are the same as those purchased by 
Petzl from TMI, and that Rock Exotica’s website directs 
consumers to two authorized dealerships in New Jersey where they 
can purchase Rock Exotica products,” id. at 7-8. As the Court 
cautioned: 
Even where a subsidiary corporation may have 
sufficient contacts with the forum state to establish 
personal jurisdiction, a plaintiff must show “more 
than mere ownership” in order to impute those contacts 
to the parent company. Seltzer v. I.C. Optics, Ltd., 
339 F. Supp. 2d 601, 609 (D.N.J. 2004); Pfundstein v. 
Omnicom Group, Inc., 666 A.2d 1013, 1016 (N.J. App. 
Div. 1995). “The activities of a parent company are 
imputed to the subsidiary only if the subsidiary is 
the parent’s agent or alter ego so that the 
independence of the separate corporate entities was 
disregarded.” Fisher v. Teva PFC SRL, 212 F. App’x 72, 
76 (3d Cir. 2006)(citing Lucas v. Gulf & Western 
Indus., Inc., 666 F.2d 800, 806 (3d Cir. 1981)). 
 
[Docket Item 84 at 10.] 
 
With this overview in mind, the Court turns to the parties’ 
specific arguments.  
 
Petzl (in whose opposition [Docket Item 142] Plaintiffs 
join [Docket Item 144]) advances three major streams of argument 
in support of a conclusion that TMI has sufficient contacts with 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 25 of 38 PageID: 4110
New Jersey such that TMI’s motion to dismiss should be denied.7 
First, Petzl argues that TMI itself has sufficient minimum 
contacts with New Jersey that would give rise to specific 
personal jurisdiction. [Docket Item 142 at 19-21.] Second, Petzl 
argues that TMI is subject to specific personal jurisdiction 
under a stream-of-commerce theory. [Docket Item 142 at 21-29.] 
Finally, Petzl argues that TMI is subject to jurisdiction in New 
Jersey because Rock Exotica, its alter ego, is subject to 
jurisdiction in New Jersey. [Docket Item 142 at 8-18.] 
A. TMI’s direct contacts 
 
Petzl argues that TMI’s contacts with New Jersey are enough 
to confer specific personal jurisdiction in this action. The 
Court disagrees.  
 
Petzl cites the fact that TMI has sourced aluminum from a 
New Jersey-based supplier on two occasions (both occurring years 
after Plaintiff purchased the kit containing the rope grab), and 
the fact that TMI may have sourced other parts or supplies from 
                     
7 Petzl also argues that TMI waived its personal jurisdiction 
challenge by producing Rock Thompson for a deposition but then 
instructing him not to answer questions relating to personal 
jurisdiction. [Docket Item 142 at 29-31.] While TMI disputes 
both this characterization and Petzl’s proposed consequences, 
the Court ultimately concludes that imputing jurisdiction based 
on this alleged failure would not be appropriate, especially 
where the answers Thompson would or could have provided do not 
appear, to this Court, to alter the crux of the Court’s analysis 
regarding the relationship of Rock Exotica, LLC to the claims at 
issue here. See Section IV.C., infra. 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 26 of 38 PageID: 4111
companies located in (or with ties to) New Jersey (including, 
e.g., Amazon).  
 
These contacts are unrelated to the claims, transactions, 
and injuries at issue in this case, as is necessary for specific 
jurisdiction to be established. See O’Connor, 496 F.3d at 318 
(“Identifying some purposeful contact with the forum is but the 
first step in the specific-jurisdiction analysis. The 
plaintiffs’ claims must also ‘arise out of or relate to’ at 
least one of those contacts.” (citations omitted)).  
B. Stream-of-commerce theory 
Petzl next argues that, based on the line of cases 
 
beginning with World-Wide Volkswagen, specific personal 
jurisdiction over TMI is appropriate because it placed the rope-
grab into the stream of interstate commerce from Utah. [Docket 
Item 142 at 21-28.] 
 
As stated previously, controlling precedent indicates that 
simply placing an item into the stream of commerce, even where 
it is foreseeable that the item will end up in the forum state, 
is not enough to establish the “purposeful availment” required 
to establish the requisite minimum contacts for specific 
jurisdiction. See Shuker, 885 F.3d at 780; O’Connor, 496 F.3d at 
317 (citing Burger King, 471 U.S. at 472, and Hanson, 357 U.S. 
at 253).  


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 27 of 38 PageID: 4112
In Shuker, the Third Circuit rejected as insufficient to 
 
establish the requisite “purposeful availment” or “deliberate 
targeting of the forum” the allegation that “PLC sold its 
products through Smith & Nephew in Pennsylvania as part of its 
efforts to sell products in the United States generally--not in 
Pennsylvania specifically.” Shuker, 885 F.3d at 780. That is 
more than what is presently alleged in this case, specific to 
Kuhar’s claims, which amounts to only the allegation that TMI 
expected (or reasonably should have expected) that Petzl would 
sell the rope grab TMI manufactured at Petzl’s request wherever 
Petzl chose, a universe that could logically include New Jersey. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that TMI did not itself have 
the requisite minimum contacts with New Jersey to rise to the 
level of purposeful availment of the benefits of doing business 
in New Jersey; nor did TMI deliberately target New Jersey when 
it manufactured and sold the rope grab to Petzl in 2005, which 
is the transaction that ultimately led to the claims Kuhar 
brings. 
C. Alter ego of Rock Exotica 
Finally, Petzl argues that jurisdiction is appropriate over 
 
TMI because jurisdiction would be appropriate over Rock Exotica, 
which is TMI’s alter ego. Petzl argues that “Rock Exotica is 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 28 of 38 PageID: 4113
subject to personal jurisdiction8 in New Jersey because it 
markets to consumers in New Jersey, has an interactive website 
where New Jersey residents can purchase products from Utah, 
interacts with retailers/wholesalers in New Jersey to whom it 
ships products for retail sale, and has two authorized dealers 
within New Jersey to sell its products at retail” [Docket Item 
142 at 8], and that TMI and Rock Exotica are alter egos. 
 
TMI advances several distinct arguments in opposition: the 
first is that the “alter ego” doctrine only applies to exercise 
jurisdiction over a parent corporation when jurisdiction already 
exists over a subsidiary corporation, and does not apply in the 
reverse situation to exercise jurisdiction over a subsidiary 
where jurisdiction exists over the parent. [Docket Item 168 at 
2, citing Shuker, 885 F.3d at 780.] Next, TMI argues that Rock 
Exotica and TMI are not sufficiently related for the “alter ego” 
doctrine to apply. [Docket Items 128-3 at 35-40; 145 at 9-11; 
168 at 2.] Finally, TMI argues that even if TMI and Rock Exotica 
are alter egos, there is no basis for New Jersey jurisdiction in 
this action over Rock Exotica either, and accordingly, none can 
be imputed to TMI. [Docket Items 128-3 at 40-41; 145 at 6-8; 168 
at 2.] On this last point, TMI argues that the Court need not 
                     
8 Petzl does not specify whether it argues that Rock Exotica is 
subject to general personal jurisdiction in New Jersey or 
specific personal jurisdiction in New Jersey in this matter, as 
TMI notes. [Docket Item 145 at 6.] 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 29 of 38 PageID: 4114
engage in a full analysis of whether Rock Exotica, LLC and TMI 
are alter egos, because the Court would not have personal 
jurisdiction over Rock Exotica, LLC. With regard to general 
jurisdiction, TMI argues, “Rock Exotica, LLC is a Delaware 
Corporation that came into existence in 2012 and that has always 
maintained its principal place of business in Utah. Rock 
Exotica, LLC is in no way ‘at home’ in New Jersey and, 
therefore, is not subject to general jurisdiction there. See 
Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746, 754 (2014).” [Docket Item 
145 at 6 n.6.] TMI similarly argues that specific jurisdiction 
would not exist as against Rock Exotica, LLC, because Kuhar’s 
claims do not arise out of or relate to Rock Exotica, LLC’s 
contacts with New Jersey, and because it would be inappropriate 
to treat Rock Exotica, LLC and its alleged “brand” predecessor, 
Rock Exotica Equipment, as the same company. Id. at 9. 
 
It is this last argument that the Court finds persuasive 
and, ultimately, dispositive. The Court finds that, regardless 
of whether TMI and Rock Exotica, LLC ought to be considered 
alter egos, jurisdiction would need to exist over Rock Exotica, 
LLC, in order for it to be imputed to TMI, and the Court cannot 
fairly say that Plaintiffs have carried their burden of 
demonstrating that Rock Exotica, LLC would be subject to 
personal jurisdiction in New Jersey in this case. Accordingly, 
the nature of the relationship between those two companies will 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 30 of 38 PageID: 4115
not serve to extend jurisdiction to TMI. Thus, it is not 
decisive that the Court finds compelling several of the factors 
advanced by Petzl in favor of finding that TMI and Rock Exotica, 
LLC are alter egos, as Rock Exotica, LLC, appears to be no more 
than the marketing, distribution, and sales arm of TMI’s 
manufacturing business and the two companies have more in common 
than not.9 
                     
9 See Petzl Br., Docket Item 142 at 16, 18 (“While there may be 
transfer of money from Rock Exotica to TMI, that transfer 
[pursuant to the alleged unwritten administrative services 
agreement] may accomplish nothing more than shifting funds from 
a company that transacts nationwide business to a business that 
claims it transacts business only within the state of Utah. . . 
. [T]he overwhelming evidence [shows] that Rock Exotica is 
simply a mere conduit for TMI to sell 94% of all items it 
manufactures, which is accomplished entirely by TMI employees. . 
. . [O]nly TMI employees create, receive and then process the 
orders [between the two companies] . . . . Rock Exotica exists 
for the exclusive purpose of selling TMI manufactured products. 
Rock Exotica only sells products manufactured by TMI, and 94% of 
products manufactured by TMI are sold by Rock Exotica. TMI 
exerts so much control that the two companies do not exist 
separately, and the independence of Rock Exotica is totally 
disregarded.”).  
 
Furthermore, the Court notes that TMI asserts, without 
substantial evidentiary support, that Rock Exotica “sources its 
products from other entities [than TMI].” [Docket Item 145 at 
11.] See n.2, supra. Under the circumstances, where the rest of 
the record suggests that Rock Exotica, LLC exists to sell the 
products manufactured by TMI, perhaps because TMI no longer 
serves as a “contract manufacturer” for Petzl, this evidence is 
de minimis and would not support a finding that the two 
companies are not alter egos, contrary to TMI’s argument that 
the alleged existence of “separate and distinct chains of 
distribution involving each company (but not both) “leave[s] no 
room for doubt that the two companies operate independently” 
regardless of “[w]hether each chain of distribution is 
financially large or small.” [Docket Item 145 at 11.]   


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 31 of 38 PageID: 4116
The Court will, therefore, for purposes of this Motion, 
 
assume that Plaintiff can demonstrate that TMI and Rock Exotica 
are alter egos. 
D. General and Specific Jurisdiction over TMI and Rock 
Exotica, LLC 
 
As stated above, jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant 
 
must be either general or specific. General jurisdiction over a 
corporation lies where the corporation is “essentially at home” 
in the forum state because its affiliations with that state are 
“so ‘continuous and systematic[.]’” Daimler, 571 U.S. at 754 
(citing Goodyear Dunlop Tires Ops., S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 
919 (2011)). The undisputed evidence suggests that Rock Exotica, 
LLC is “at home” in Utah and would be subject to general 
personal jurisdiction there. Rock Exotica, LLC’s base of 
operations is in Utah--one of its many commonalities with TMI--
and the work that is done by it (or on its behalf by TMI 
employees) is done in Utah. Cf. Daimler, 571 U.S. at 129-30 
(discussing Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 
448 (1952), which held that Ohio had general jurisdiction over 
the defendant ‘without offending due process” “because Ohio was 
the corporation’s principal, if temporary, place of business” 
(internal citations omitted)). “For an individual, the paradigm 
forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the 
individual’s domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 32 of 38 PageID: 4117
place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at 
home.” Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 924. Where a “foreign subsidiary[y 
is] ‘in no sense at home in [the forum state],’” the Supreme 
Court has held that that subsidiary “could not be required to 
submit to the general jurisdiction of that State’s courts.” 
Daimler, 571 U.S. at 757 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 929). 
Here, it appears effectively beyond question that neither TMI 
nor Rock Exotica, LLC, is “at home” in New Jersey, and that 
Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that personal jurisdiction over 
either entity is appropriate in New Jersey.   
 
Turning, then, to specific jurisdiction, an essential 
element is that the claim at issue in the instant case must 
arise from (or relate to) the “minimum contacts” the non-
resident defendant has or had with the forum state. Here, Rock 
Exotica, LLC likely (or at least arguably) has such minimum 
contacts, as it maintains an official relationship with more 
than one New Jersey “authorized dealer” and markets the products 
it sells (and that TMI manufactures) to end-users in New Jersey 
(as well as other states). However, this case does not arise 
from those contacts, although those contacts are analogous and 
similar to the contacts that did lead to the claims in this 
case, involving (as they do) the sale to New Jersey residents of 
fall-prevention gear manufactured by TMI through an 
intermediary. And had such gear, manufactured by TMI and sold or 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 33 of 38 PageID: 4118
marketed by Rock Exotica, LLC, failed and injured a New Jersey 
consumer, perhaps specific jurisdiction would exist over Rock 
Exotica, LLC, and, by extension, TMI (on the basis of its “alter 
ego” status), given that shipping the product to New Jersey for 
use by a New Jersey resident would constitute sufficient 
“minimum contacts” to assert specific jurisdiction. See Columbia 
Metal Culvert Co. v. Kaiser Indus. Corp., 526 F.2d 724, 729 (3d 
Cir. 1975) (holding that “[a] single shipment is sufficient to 
subject a foreign individual or corporation to personal 
jurisdiction.”); One World Botanicals, 987 F. Supp. at 324 
(“defendant’s consummation of a business transaction [where it 
shipped a product into New Jersey] bars it from now arguing that 
it has not purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing 
business in New Jersey,”); see also Spelling Goldberg 
Productions v. Bodek & Rhodes, 452 F. Supp. 452, 454 (E.D.Pa. 
1978)(finding that in personam jurisdiction over non-resident 
defendants was proper in a trademark infringement action where 
defendants shipped allegedly infringing merchandise into 
Pennsylvania.). 
 
The critical difference here is that Rock Exotica, LLC did 
not sell, vend, or otherwise interact with the product that Mr. 
Kuhar bought. In fact, Rock Exotica, LLC undisputedly did not 
exist at the time when Mr. Kuhar bought the kit that included 
the TMI-manufactured rope grab in 2006.  


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 34 of 38 PageID: 4119
Petzl contends that the Court should, effectively, compress 
 
not merely two corporations (TMI and Rock Exotica, LLC), but 
actually three--essentially combining, for jurisdictional 
purposes, TMI (the Utah-only manufacturer), Rock Exotica, LLC 
(the Utah seller with minimum contacts to New Jersey), and Rock 
Exotica Equipment, a corporation in Utah that Petzl alleges is, 
effectively, the precursor to Rock Exotica, LLC, and that may or 
may not have shared the same or similar minimum contacts with 
New Jersey.  
 
However, even if the Court were to compress all three 
corporate entities in this fashion, specific jurisdiction still 
would not lie in this case. This is so because Kuhar’s rope grab 
was not delivered into his hands in 2006 by or through the 
actions of Rock Exotica, LLC, Rock Exotica Equipment, or TMI. It 
is undisputed that the kit Kuhar purchased and subsequently used 
in New Jersey, containing the TMI-manufactured rope grab, came 
into his hands by way of co-defendants Bailey’s (of California) 
and Petzl (of France and Utah), and not by way of any 
transaction or contacts that TMI or any related entity had or 
may have had with any person or entity in the state of New 
Jersey. See D’Jamoos, 566 F.3d at 106 (“[T]he fact that other 
Pilatus planes have followed a certain path to Pennsylvania and 
other states cannot provide the necessary connection between 
Pilatus and Pennsylvania to support specific jurisdiction in 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 35 of 38 PageID: 4120
this case, because the aircraft involved here reached 
Pennsylvania by a series of fortuitous circumstances independent 
of any distribution channel Pilatus employed. If we held 
otherwise, we impermissibly would remove the ‘arising from or 
related to’ requirement from the specific jurisdiction test and 
unjustifiably would treat the stream-of-commerce theory as a 
source of general jurisdiction.”)(emphasis in original).  
 
Accordingly, the facts that give rise to the claims at 
issue in this case cannot fairly be said, upon consideration of 
the jurisdictional record, to arise out of any contacts that 
TMI, Rock Exotica, LLC, Rock Exotica Equipment, or any other 
sufficiently TMI-related entity had with the state of New 
Jersey. See Grimes v. Vitalink Comms. Corp., 17 F.3d 1553, 1559 
(3d Cir. 1994)(“Unlike establishing general jurisdiction where 
the party must be shown to have ‘maintained continuous and 
substantial forum affiliations,’ establishing specific 
jurisdiction, at a minimum, requires only that a party be shown 
to have committed at least one act in the relevant forum which 
is substantially related to the claim being 
adjudicated”)(internal citations omitted; emphasis added); 
O’Connor, 496 F.3d at 318-23 (“The causal connection can be 
somewhat looser than the tort concept of proximate causation . . 
. but it must nonetheless be intimate enough to keep the quid 
pro quo [of the non-resident defendant’s enjoyment of the 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 36 of 38 PageID: 4121
benefits of its contacts with the forum state] proportional and 
personal jurisdiction reasonably foreseeable”); see also Gehling 
v. St. George’s Sch. of Med., Ltd., 773 F.2d 539, 544 
(intentional infliction of emotion distress claim based on 
alleged misrepresentation of cause of death “arises out of” 
contact with Pennsylvania, where defendant allegedly made the 
misrepresentation). Nor can it fairly be said, under these 
circumstances, that the claims are sufficiently “related to” the 
contacts Rock Exotica, LLC; Rock Exotica Equipment; or TMI had 
or have with the state of New Jersey. See D’Jamoos, 566 F.3d at 
104 (plane-crash-related claims do not “arise out of or relate 
to at least one of Pilatus’s purposeful contacts with the forum” 
of “sending two employees to Pennsylvania to view displays at a 
potential supplier, and . . . purchasing $1,030,139 in goods or 
services from suppliers in Pennsylvania during the five-year 
period preceding this litigation”); Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 
418 (“mere purchases, even if occurring at regular intervals, 
are not enough to warrant a State’s assertion of in personam 
jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action 
not related to those purchase transactions”). See also Formula 
One Licensing BV v. Valentine, No. 14-5812, 2016 WL 7175591, at 
*6 (D.N.J. Dec. 8, 2016)(“To establish specific jurisdiction, 
contacts with the proposed forum must not only meet or exceed 
constitutionally minimum contacts, they must also be related to 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 37 of 38 PageID: 4122
the cause of action.”)(citing Reliance Steel Products Co. v. 
Watson, Ess, Marshall & Enggas, 675 F.2d 587, 588 (3d Cir. 
1982)(“The initial determination that must be made is whether 
the claim or cause of action which is being pursued arises from 
the defendant’s forum related activities or from non-forum 
related activities”)); O’Connor, 496 F.3d at 322-24 (finding 
both: that cause of action would not have arisen but for 
defendant’s contacts with forum state; and that “a meaningful 
link exists between a legal obligation that arose in the forum 
and the substances of the plaintiffs’ claims[,]” “justif[ying] 
the exercise of specific jurisdiction as a quid pro quo for 
Sandy Lane’s enjoyment of the right to form binding contracts in 
Pennsylvania”). 
 
For that reason, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not 
met their burden of demonstrating that specific jurisdiction can 
be imputed to TMI on the basis of an alter ego relationship with 
Rock Exotica, LLC (or an alleged predecessor corporation of Rock 
Exotica, LLC--i.e., Rock Exotica Equipment--using the same 
“brand”). Having already dispensed with the proposition that 
Plaintiffs can demonstrate Rock Exotica, LLC’s susceptibility to 
general personal jurisdiction in New Jersey, the Court therefore 
finds that jurisdiction may not be extended to TMI on the basis 
that it is an alter ego of Rock Exotica, LLC, related to the 
transaction at issue in this case. 


Case 1:16-cv-00395-JBS-JS   Document 234   Filed 08/06/18   Page 38 of 38 PageID: 4123
Accordingly, the Court does not reach the question of 
 
whether exercising jurisdiction over TMI would comport with 
traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. See 
Int’l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316.  
 
Because Plaintiffs have not established that TMI meets the 
required minimum contacts to establish specific jurisdiction, is 
“at home” in New Jersey to establish general jurisdiction, or is 
the “alter ego” of a company over which general or specific 
jurisdiction could be asserted in this action, TMI’s motion to 
dismiss pursuant to F.R.C.P. 12(b)(2) is granted.  
 
 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth in the preceding discussion the 
 
Court finds that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendant 
TMI, and TMI’s motion to dismiss shall be granted. The 
accompanying Order will be entered.

Before the Court is Defendant Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (“Lockheed 
 
Martin”) Request for Entry of Judgment.  On December 23, 2013, this Court 
granted Lockheed Martin’s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement 
against all of Plaintiff Aleksandr L. Yufa’s claims of infringement with respect to 
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,034,769 and 6,346,983 (the “Patents-in-Suit”).  (Dkt. No. 292.)   
On January 10, 2014, both parties stipulated to a dismissal, without 
prejudice, of Lockheed Martin’s Counterclaim for declaratory judgment of 
invalidity, unenforceability, and non-infringement of the Patents-in-Suit, pursuant 
to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) (Dkt. No. 307), and on January 
16, 2014, this Court entered an Order on Voluntary Dismissal by Stipulation 
Without Prejudice of Lockheed Martin’s Counterclaim Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 
41(a)(1)(A)(ii) (Dkt. No. 309).   
Pursuant to Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and in 
accordance with this Court’s Order Granting Defendant’s Motion for Summary 
Judgment, the parties’ Voluntary Dismissal by Stipulation Without Prejudice of 
Lockheed Martin’s Counterclaim Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), and 
this Court’s Order on Voluntary Dismissal by Stipulation Without Prejudice of 
Lockheed Martin’s Counterclaim Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), the 
Court hereby renders the following Judgment: 
1. 
Lockheed Martin has not infringed Claims 1 or 4-6 of U.S. Patent No. 
6,034,769. 
Lockheed Martin has not infringed Claims 6-8 of U.S. Patent No. 
6,346,983. 
Lockheed Martin’s Counterclaim for declaratory judgment of 
invalidity, unenforceability, and non-infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 
6,034,769 and 6,346,983 is dismissed without prejudice.

O R D E R
In separate lawsuits Plaintiff Trish Lee McCloud, a passenger
on a motorcycle being operated by William Booker (Case No. 04-1118)
and Plaintiff William Booker (Case No. 04-1159) sued Defendants
Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd. (Dunlop) and The Goodyear
Tire & Rubber Company (Goodyear) (collectively referred to as
Dunlop/Goodyear) for injuries sustained in an accident involving
the motorcycle caused by allegedly defective tires manufactured
and/or distributed by Dunlop/Goodyear.  These two cases were
consolidated under Case No. 04-1114. 
Before the Court today is the motion of William Booker.
Plaintiff/Counterdefendant in Case No. 04-1159 for summary judgment
on the counterclaim of Dunlop/Goodyear for contribution pursuant to
Illinois state law by Dunlop and Goodyear in connection with the
claims of Plaintiff Trish Lee McCloud. 
The summary judgment motion was e-filed August 5, 2005, and
pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(D), Dunlop/Goodyear was required to file

1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 93    Page 2 of 3                                              
     
a response to the motion within a 21 day period that expired August
26, 2005.  Their failure to respond is deemed an admission of the
motion.  Local Rule 7.1(D)(2).
The summary judgment motion is part of a broader motion also
seeking a finding that Plaintiff’s claim against Booker was settled
in good faith thereby barring the contribution action against
Booker by Dunlop/Goodyear in their counterclaim.  
There does not appear to be any dispute as to any material
fact and the record before the Court includes the following
exhibits:
(a) Trish Lee McCloud’s complaint;
(b) Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd., and The
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company’s amended answer and
affirmative defenses;
(c) Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd., and the
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company’s counterclaim for
contribution against William Booker;
(d) William Booker’s answer to the counterclaim and
contribution;
(e) William Booker’s answers to Goodyear Dunlop Tires North
America, Ltd, and The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company’s
interrogatories;
(f) certification of records/attestation of exemplified
copies, petition for approval of settlement, affidavit of
Candy Hall and order approving settlement, Berrien County
Probate Court, Second Judicial Circuit, Fifth Judicial
District, State of Michigan;

(g) release.
In consideration of the record there is no genuine issue as to
any material fact and Plaintiff/Counterdefendant William Booker in
Case No. 04-1159 is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
