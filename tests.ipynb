(Dkt. No. 621.) Having considered the Motion, and for the reasons stated herein, \\nthe Court finds that it should be DENIED. \\nI. \\nBACKGROUND \\nChamberlain filed a Complaint on March 10, 2021, alleging infringement by Defendants \\nOverhead Door Corporation and GMI Holdings Inc. (collectively, “Defendants” or “OHD”) of \\nU.S. Patent Nos. 8,587,404 (the “’404 patent”); 9,644,416 (the “’416 patent”); 7,852,212 (the \\n“’212 patent”); and 8,144,011 (the “’011 patent”) (collectively, the “Original Asserted Patents”). \\n(Dkt. No. 1.) Chamberlain accused of infringement certain garage door openers sold by \\nDefendants. (See generally id.)  \\nAfter a jury trial was held on the Original Asserted Patents in March of 2022, a new trial \\nwas awarded only as to the ’404 patent. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 356, 386.) \\nA trial on the ’404 patent commenced on January 23, 2023. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 595, 596, 597, \\n598, 602, 610, 611, 612, 614, 615, 616.) On January 27, 2023, the jury returned a verdict finding \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  31636\\nthat Defendants infringed Claims 4 and 20 of the ’404 patent, that Defendants’ infringement was \\nnot willful, and that the Asserted Claims are not invalid as obvious or for improper inventorship. \\n(Dkt. No. 599.) The jury awarded $43.4 million in damages, $2.7 million of which represents a \\nrunning royalty. (Id.)  \\nChamberlain filed the instant Motion on March 2, 2023, urging the Court to overturn the \\njury’s finding of no willfulness pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). (Dkt. No. 621.)  \\nII. \\nLEGAL STANDARD \\na. Judgment as a Matter of Law \\n“Judgment as a matter of law is proper when ‘a reasonable jury would not have a legally \\nsufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.’” Abraham v. Alpha Chi Omega, 708 \\nF.3d 614, 620 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)). The non-moving party must identify \\n“substantial evidence” to support its positions. TGIP, Inc. v. AT&T Corp., 527 F. Supp. 2d 561, \\n569 (E.D. Tex. 2007). “Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant \\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.” Eli Lilly & Co. \\nv. Aradigm Corp., 376 F.3d 1352, 1363 (Fed.

LG Elecs., Inc., 880 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing Bagby Elevator Co. v. Schindler \\nElevator Corp., 609 F.3d 768, 773 (5th Cir. 2010)). A court must “resolve all conflicting evidence \\nin favor of [the verdict] and refrain from weighing the evidence or making credibility \\ndeterminations.” Gomez v. St. Jude Med. Diag. Div.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b); Navigant \\nConsulting, Inc. v. Wilkinson, 508 F.3d 277, 288 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Flowers v. S. Reg’l \\nPhysician Servs. Inc., 247 F.3d 229, 238). \\nIII. DISCUSSION \\nChamberlain urges that the evidence presented at trial does not support the jury’s finding \\nthat OHD did not willfully infringe the ’404 patent. (Dkt. No. 621 at 1.) Chamberlain also argues \\nthat “enhanced damages are warranted not only due to OHD’s willful infringement, but because \\nof its repeated litigation misconduct, which is outlined in detail in Chamberlain’s Motion for \\nSanctions (Dkt. No. 348) and Chamberlain’s Motion for an Exceptional Case Finding and \\nAttorneys’ Fees (Dkt. No. 620).” (Id.)  \\nOHD argues that Chamberlain waived this argument because it “failed to move for \\njudgment as a matter of law on the issue of willfulness before submission of the case to the jury \\nunder Rule 50(a).” (Dkt. No. 631 at 1.) OHD also contends that Chamberlain’s argument fails on \\nthe merits because there was substantial evidence at trial supporting the jury’s finding of no willful \\ninfringement. (Id. at 4–9.) Further, since an award of enhanced damages is “predicated on the \\nassumption that Overhead Door willfully infringed,” OHD contends that Chamberlain’s request \\nfor enhanced damages likewise fails. (Id. at 10–11) (citations and quotations omitted). \\nChamberlain argues in response that it did not waive its motion under Rule 50(b) pursuant \\nto the Fifth Circuit’s de minimis exception to Rule 50. (Dkt. No. 635 at 1.) Chamberlain contends \\n \\n3 \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  31638\\nthat the Fifth Circuit “has found that when the purposes of Rule 50 are met, it ‘routinely excuses \\ntechnical noncompliance with the pre-submission requirement’ of filing a motion for JMOL before \\nthe case is submitted to the jury ‘by invoking a de minimis exception to the rule.’” (Id. (citing \\nTaylor Publ’g Co. v. Jostens Inc., 216 F.3d 465, 472 (5th Cir. 2000)) (alterations omitted).)  \\nThe Court agrees with OHD that Chamberlain waived its willfulness argument by failing \\nto move under 50(a). (See Dkt. No. 615 at 226:9–16; 228:17–24.) A motion under Rule 50(b) is \\nnot allowed unless the movant sought relief on similar grounds under Rule 50(a) before the case \\nwas submitted to the jury. Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471, 485, n.5 (2008). The Court \\ndoes not find that the de minimis exception applies in this case.  \\nWhile it is true that Chamberlain presented argument in response to OHD’s affirmative \\n50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law of no willfulness (see Dkt. No. 615 at 253:9–254:18), \\nthe Court finds that such does not have the same effect as affirmatively moving for judgment as a \\nmatter of law on willfulness. See Arsement v. Spinnaker Exploration Co., LLC, 400 F.3d 238, 247 \\n(5th Cir. 2005) (“If a party fails to raise an issue in its Rule 50(a)(1) motions at trial, it may not do \\nso in its post-trial Rule 50(b) motion.”); Adaptix, Inc. v. Alcatel-Lucent USA, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. \\nLEXIS 206065, at *13–14 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 30, 2016) (“Therefore, because Adaptix did not identify \\nlack of enablement as a specific ground in its Rule 50(a) motion, Adaptix waived its right to renew \\nit as part of its Rule 50(b) motion.”); Golden Hour Data Sys. v. emsCharts, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. \\nLEXIS 95640, at *6, 10 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 31, 2014) (“emsCharts altogether failed to raise the issues \\nof willful infringement or invalidity in its Rule 50(a) motion... emsCharts has waived its right to \\npresent the willful infringement [argument]…in its Rule 50(b) motion[.]”).1  \\n \\n1 See also Medisim Ltd. v. BestMed, LLC, 758 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“[W]e conclude that BestMed \\nforfeited its right to move for JMOL on anticipation” because “BestMed’s counsel made this statement in opposition \\nto Medisim’s motion for JMOL under Rule 50(a); BestMed never moved on its own for JMOL on anticipation before \\nthe case was submitted to the jury. Indeed, BestMed’s counsel conceded that BestMed ‘did not expressly say [that] \\n4 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 5 of 5 PageID #:  31639\\nAccordingly, because the Court finds that Chamberlain waived its argument as to \\nwillfulness, the Court need not reach the arguments on enhanced damages. Further, the Court finds \\nthat even absent Chamberlain’s waiver, there was sufficient evidence before the jury to support \\ntheir finding of no willfulness and JMOL is not warranted in this instance. The Court addresses by \\nseparate order Chamberlain’s Motion for an Exceptional Case Finding and Attorneys’ Fees.  \\nIV. CONCLUSION \\nFor the reasons stated above, Chamberlain’s Motion (Dkt. No. 621) should be DENIED.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nwe cross-move for JMOL when they moved for JMOL on the anticipation issue.’”) (analyzing Second Circuit law) \\n(citations and quotations omitted).  \\n \\n5 \\n.\\n____________________________________\\nRODNEY  GILSTRAP\\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\\nSo ORDERED and SIGNED this 4th day of April, 2023.\\n\\x0c', \"Case 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 600   Filed 01/27/23   Page 1 of 9 PageID #:  23164\\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\\nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\\nMARSHALL DIVISION\\nTHE CHAMBERLAIN GROUP LLC, §\\nPlaintiff, §\\nv § CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:21-CV-00084-JRG\\nOVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION, GMI §\\nHOLDINGS INC., §\\nDefendants. §\\nVERDICT FORM\\nIn answering the following questions and completing this Verdict Form, you are to\\nfollow all the instructions that I have given you in the Court s Final Jury Instructions.

The Chamberlain Group LLC opposes.  Be-\\ncause the district court did not clearly abuse its discretion \\nin denying transfer, we deny the petition.  \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  3775\\n2 \\nIN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\nBACKGROUND \\n Overhead, and its subsidiary, GMI, are in the business \\nof manufacturing and selling garage and other barrier door \\nopening devices.  Overhead maintains its principal place of \\nbusiness within the Eastern District of Texas in Lewisville, \\nTexas. GMI maintains its headquarters in Ohio, but also \\nhas an engineering and testing center within the Northern \\nDistrict of Texas in Dallas, Texas.     \\n On March 10, 2021, Chamberlain brought this suit in \\nthe Eastern District of Texas, accusing several of OHD’s \\nbarrier opener products of infringing four Chamberlain pa-\\ntents related to movable barrier systems.  The next day, \\nChamberlain filed a second complaint against OHD in the \\nNorthern District of Texas, asserting infringement of the \\nsame patents against the same accused products.   \\n OHD moved to transfer the Eastern Texas action pur-\\nsuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to Northern Texas.  OHD ar-\\ngued that “[a]ll of the Accused Products were designed, \\ntested, and built by Defendant [GMI], not by Defendant \\nOverhead,” and that “the engineers and individuals who \\nworked on the Accused Products and other likely witnesses \\nall live within 30–60 minutes of downtown Dallas.”  Mot. \\nat 5–6, Chamberlain Grp., LLC v. Overhead Door Corp., \\n2:21-cv-84 (E.D. Tex. May 4, 2021), ECF No. 21.   \\nOHD also argued that transfer would promote “con-\\nsistency and judicial efficiency.”  Id. at 11.  In support of \\nthat argument, OHD pointed to the second-filed Northern \\nTexas action brought by Chamberlain as well as OHD’s \\nown pending action against Chamberlain arising out of lit-\\nigation brought by Chamberlain in the International Trade \\nCommission. Overhead Door Corp. & GMI Holdings, Inc. v. \\nChamberlain Grp., Inc., No. 3:20-cv-1779 (the “-1779 ac-\\ntion”).  The -1779 action involves OHD’s infringement alle-\\ngations against Chamberlain products that are the subject \\nof OHD’s counterclaims in the Northern Texas action but \\nare not at issue in the instant litigation.   \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 3 of 5 PageID #:  3776\\nIN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\n 3 \\nIn its opposition, Chamberlain pointed out that OHD \\n \\nhad failed to identify any individuals by title or name who \\nreside in Northern Texas.  It also argued that potential wit-\\nnesses relevant to OHD’s license defense would likely come \\nfrom Lewisville, in the Eastern District of Texas.  Cham-\\nberlain further argued that transfer would not result in sig-\\nnificant judicial economy benefits.  In that regard, \\nChamberlain noted that it “intend[s] to dismiss th[e] \\nNorthern District action now that Defendants have an-\\nswered the Eastern District complaint,” Opp’n to Mot. to \\nTransfer at 13, Chamberlain Grp., LLC v. Overhead Door \\nCorp., 2:21-cv-84 (E.D. Tex. May 18, 2021), ECF No. 29, \\nand further noted that the -1779 action has been stayed \\npending the outcome of the ITC litigation.    \\n On September 10, 2021, the district court denied \\nOHD’s motion.  The district court concluded that the court \\ncongestion factor weighed against transfer and that the re-\\nmaining factors were neutral.  In particular, the court \\nfound that OHD had failed to specifically identify any non-\\nparty witnesses who may testify at trial; OHD failed to pro-\\nvide sufficient information to determine whether the trans-\\nferee venue was more convenient for willing witnesses; and \\nthat there was not a substantial risk of duplicative litiga-\\ntion because OHD had moved to dismiss the second-filed \\nNorthern Texas action and because it was uncertain when \\nthe -1779 action would again resume.  On balance, the dis-\\ntrict court determined that OHD had failed to establish \\nthat the transferee venue was clearly more convenient for \\nthe litigation, and therefore denied the motion.    \\nDISCUSSION \\nThe standard for mandamus relief is demanding.  A pe-\\n \\ntitioner must establish, among other things, that it has a \\nclear and indisputable legal right to relief.  Cheney v. U.S. \\nDist. Ct. for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 381 (2004) (citation omit-\\nted).  Under applicable Fifth Circuit law, on mandamus, we \\nreview only for “clear abuses of discretion that produce \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  3777\\n4 \\nIN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\npatently erroneous results.”  In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc., \\n545 F.3d 304, 312 (5th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  We cannot say \\nthat OHD has met this standard.   \\n \\nThe district court found that OHD had failed to demon-\\nstrate that the Northern District of Texas was more con-\\nvenient for potential willing witnesses.  We see no clear \\nerror in the district court’s determination.  Chamberlain’s \\nchosen forum, located in the district where one of the de-\\nfendants is headquartered, appears to be convenient for at \\nleast some potential witnesses.  We have also held that a \\ndistrict court acts reasonably when it refuses to weigh the \\nwilling witness factor in favor of transfer if unable to deter-\\nmine from the movant’s presentation of the factor that \\nthere are more potential witnesses in the transferee venue \\nthan the plaintiff’s chosen forum.  See In re Apple Inc., 743 \\nF.3d 1377, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Here, the district court\\nconcluded that OHD had failed to provide sufficient evi-\\ndence to make that determination.  And we are not pre-\\npared on mandamus to disturb that finding.\\nThe district court also reasonably determined that the \\nNorthern District of Texas did not have a comparative ad-\\nvantage with regard to compelling unwilling witnesses.  \\nOHD failed to identify any specific third-party potential \\nwitnesses in its motion that may need to be compelled.  \\nMoreover, a district court in the Eastern District of Texas \\ncan subpoena a person to attend a trial, hearing, or dispo-\\nsition within the state of Texas where the person resides, \\nis employed, or regularly transacts business in person, if \\nthe person is commanded to attend a trial and would not \\nincur a substantial expense.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \\n45(c)(1)(B)(ii).  Because the denial of OHD’s motion to \\ntransfer here would not result in a substantial burden on \\nwitnesses required to travel from Dallas to Marshall, \\nTexas, OHD has not shown that the compulsory-process \\nfactor clearly weighs in favor of transfer.  \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 5 of 5 PageID #:  3778\\nIN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\n 5 \\n OHD has also not made a compelling showing on the \\nother factors.  OHD contends that the district court erred \\nin not weighing the local interest factor in favor of transfer \\nbecause the accused products were designed and tested in \\nDallas, Texas and none of the underlying events giving rise \\nto this infringement action occurred in the Eastern District \\nof Texas.  But OHD failed to raise any specific argument \\nthat the local interest factor favored transfer in its motion, \\nand a district court does not err, let alone, clearly so, by not \\naccepting an argument it was not properly asked to con-\\nsider.  We also cannot say that OHD has shown that judi-\\ncial economy would be clearly served by transferring the \\ncase here.  The district court plausibly found that OHD had \\nnot shown a significant risk of duplicative suits between \\nthe parties because Chamberlain moved to dismiss or \\ntransfer the Northern Texas action and because the -1779 \\naction involved different patents and it was uncertain as to \\nwhen the stay of that litigation would be lifted.   \\nAccordingly, \\nIT IS ORDERED THAT: \\nThe petition is denied. \\nDecember 07, 2021 \\nDate \\nFOR THE COURT \\n/s/ Peter R.

This order supplements all other discovery rules and orders. It streamlines Electronically Stored \\nInformation (“ESI”) production to promote a “just, speedy, and inexpensive determination” of this \\naction, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 1.\\n2. This order may be modified in the court’s discretion or by agreement of the parties.  The \\nparties shall jointly submit any proposed modifications within 30 days after the Federal Rule \\nof Civil Procedure 16 conference.  If the parties cannot resolve their disagreements \\nregarding these modifications, the parties shall submit their competing proposals and a summary \\nof their dispute.\\n3. A party’s meaningful compliance with this order and efforts to promote efficiency and reduce \\ncosts will be considered in cost-shifting determinations.\\n4. Absent a showing of good cause, general ESI production requests under Federal Rules of Civil \\nProcedure 34 and 45, or compliance with a mandatory disclosure requirement of this Court, shall \\nnot include metadata. However, fields showing the date and time that the document was sent and \\nreceived, as well as the complete distribution list, shall generally be included in the production if \\nsuch fields exist.\\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 56   Filed 07/22/21   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  1540\\n5. Absent agreement of the parties or further order of this court, the following parameters shall\\napply to ESI production:\\nA. General Document Image Format.  Each electronic document shall be produced in\\nsingle-page Tagged Image File Format (“TIFF”) format.  TIFF files shall be single page and\\nshall be named with a unique production number followed by the appropriate file extension. \\nLoad files shall be provided to indicate the location and unitization of the TIFF files.  If a\\ndocument is more than one page, the unitization of the document and any attachments and/or\\naffixed notes shall be maintained as they existed in the original document.\\nB. Text-Searchable Documents.  No party has an obligation to make its production text-\\nsearchable; however, if a party’s documents already exist in text-searchable format\\nindependent of this litigation, or are converted to text-searchable format for use in this\\nlitigation, including for use by the producing party’s counsel, then such documents shall be\\nproduced in the same text-searchable format at no cost to the receiving party.\\nC. Footer.  Each document image shall contain a footer with a sequentially ascending\\nproduction number.\\nD. Native Files.  A party that receives a document produced in a format specified above\\nmay make a reasonable request to receive the document in its native format, and upon receipt\\nof such a request, the producing party shall produce the document in its native format.\\nE. No Backup Restoration Required.  Absent a showing of good cause, no party need\\nrestore any form of media upon which backup data is maintained in a party’s normal or\\nallowed processes, including but not limited to backup tapes, disks, SAN, and other forms\\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 56   Filed 07/22/21   Page 3 of 5 PageID #:  1541\\nof media, to comply with its discovery obligations in the present case.\\nF.

General ESI production requests under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 34 and 45, or\\ncompliance with a mandatory disclosure order of this court, shall not include e-mail or other forms\\nof electronic correspondence (collectively “e-mail”). To obtain e-mail parties must propound\\nspecific e-mail production requests.\\n7.  E-mail production requests shall be phased to occur timely after the parties have exchanged initial\\ndisclosures, a specific listing of likely e-mail custodians, a specific identification of the fifteen most\\nsignificant listed e-mail custodians in view of the pleaded claims and defenses,1 infringement\\ncontentions and accompanying documents pursuant to P.R. 3-1 and 3-2, invalidity contentions and\\naccompanying documents pursuant to P.R. 3-3 and 3-4,  and preliminary information relevant to\\ndamages.  The exchange of this information shall occur at the time required under the Federal Rules\\nof Civil Procedure, Local Rules, or by order of the court.  Each requesting party may also propound\\nup to five written discovery requests and take one deposition per producing party to identify the\\nproper custodians, proper search terms, and proper time frame for e-mail production requests.  The\\ncourt may allow additional discovery upon a showing of good cause.  \\n8. E-mail production requests shall identify the custodian, search terms, and time frame.

The parties may jointly agree to modify this limit without the court’s\\nleave.  The court shall consider contested requests for additional or fewer custodians per producing\\nparty, upon showing a distinct need based on the size, complexity, and issues of this specific case. \\n9. Each requesting party shall limit its e-mail production requests to a total of ten search terms per\\ncustodian per party.  The parties may jointly agree to modify this limit without the court’s leave.  \\nThe court shall consider contested requests for additional or fewer search terms per custodian, upon\\nshowing a distinct need based on the size, complexity, and issues of this specific case.  The search\\nterms shall be narrowly tailored to particular issues. Indiscriminate terms, such as the producing\\ncompany’s name or its product name, are inappropriate unless combined with narrowing search\\ncriteria that sufficiently reduce the risk of overproduction.  A conjunctive combination of multiple\\nwords or phrases (e.g., “computer” and “system”) narrows the search and shall count as a single\\nsearch term.  A disjunctive combination of multiple words or phrases (e.g., “computer” or “system”)\\nbroadens the search, and thus each word or phrase shall count as a separate search term unless they\\nare variants of the same word.  Use of narrowing search criteria (e.g., “and,” “but not,” “w/x”) is\\nencouraged to limit the production and shall be considered when determining whether to shift costs\\nfor disproportionate discovery. \\n10. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 502(d), the inadvertent production of a privileged or work\\nproduct protected ESI is not a waiver in the pending case or in any other federal or state proceeding.\\n11.

(Dkt. No. 621.) Having considered the Motion, and for the reasons stated herein,', 'the Court finds that it should be DENIED. \\nI. \\nBACKGROUND \\nChamberlain filed a Complaint on March 10, 2021, alleging infringement by Defendants \\nOverhead Door Corporation and GMI Holdings Inc. (collectively, “Defendants” or “OHD”) of \\nU.S. Patent Nos. 8,587,404 (the “’404 patent”); 9,644,416 (the “’416 patent”); 7,852,212 (the \\n“’212 patent”); and 8,144,011 (the “’011 patent”) (collectively, the “Original Asserted Patents”). \\n(Dkt. No. 1.) Chamberlain accused of infringement certain garage door openers sold by \\nDefendants. (See generally id.)  \\nAfter a jury trial was held on the Original Asserted Patents in March of 2022, a new trial', 'was awarded only as to the ’404 patent. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 356, 386.) \\nA trial on the ’404 patent commenced on January 23, 2023. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 595, 596, 597, \\n598, 602, 610, 611, 612, 614, 615, 616.) On January 27, 2023, the jury returned a verdict finding \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  31636\\nthat Defendants infringed Claims 4 and 20 of the ’404 patent, that Defendants’ infringement was \\nnot willful, and that the Asserted Claims are not invalid as obvious or for improper inventorship. \\n(Dkt. No. 599.) The jury awarded $43.4 million in damages, $2.7 million of which represents a', 'running royalty. (Id.)  \\nChamberlain filed the instant Motion on March 2, 2023, urging the Court to overturn the \\njury’s finding of no willfulness pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). (Dkt. No. 621.)  \\nII. \\nLEGAL STANDARD \\na. Judgment as a Matter of Law \\n“Judgment as a matter of law is proper when ‘a reasonable jury would not have a legally \\nsufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.’” Abraham v. Alpha Chi Omega, 708 \\nF.3d 614, 620 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)). The non-moving party must identify \\n“substantial evidence” to support its positions. TGIP, Inc. v. AT&T Corp., 527 F. Supp. 2d 561,', '569 (E.D. Tex. 2007). “Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant \\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.” Eli Lilly & Co. \\nv. Aradigm Corp., 376 F.3d 1352, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  \\n“The Fifth Circuit views all evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict and will \\nreverse a jury’s verdict only if the evidence points so overwhelmingly in favor of one party that \\nreasonable jurors could not arrive at any contrary conclusion.” Core Wireless Licensing S.A.R.L. \\nv. LG Elecs., Inc., 880 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing Bagby Elevator Co. v. Schindler', 'Elevator Corp., 609 F.3d 768, 773 (5th Cir. 2010)). A court must “resolve all conflicting evidence \\nin favor of [the verdict] and refrain from weighing the evidence or making credibility \\ndeterminations.” Gomez v. St. Jude Med. Diag. Div. Inc., 442 F.3d 919, 937–38 (5th Cir. 2006). \\n \\n2 \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 3 of 5 PageID #:  31637\\nRule 50(a)(2) requires the moving party, when moving for JMOL before the case is \\nsubmitted to the jury, to “specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts that entitle the \\nmovant to the judgment.” Generally, a party who fails to present a Rule 50(a) motion on an issue', 'prior to the close of evidence waives both its right to present a Rule 50(b) motion after judgment \\nand its right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b); Navigant \\nConsulting, Inc. v. Wilkinson, 508 F.3d 277, 288 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Flowers v. S. Reg’l \\nPhysician Servs. Inc., 247 F.3d 229, 238). \\nIII. DISCUSSION \\nChamberlain urges that the evidence presented at trial does not support the jury’s finding \\nthat OHD did not willfully infringe the ’404 patent. (Dkt. No. 621 at 1.) Chamberlain also argues \\nthat “enhanced damages are warranted not only due to OHD’s willful infringement, but because', 'of its repeated litigation misconduct, which is outlined in detail in Chamberlain’s Motion for \\nSanctions (Dkt. No. 348) and Chamberlain’s Motion for an Exceptional Case Finding and \\nAttorneys’ Fees (Dkt. No. 620).” (Id.)  \\nOHD argues that Chamberlain waived this argument because it “failed to move for \\njudgment as a matter of law on the issue of willfulness before submission of the case to the jury \\nunder Rule 50(a).” (Dkt. No. 631 at 1.) OHD also contends that Chamberlain’s argument fails on \\nthe merits because there was substantial evidence at trial supporting the jury’s finding of no willful \\ninfringement. (Id. at 4–9.) Further, since an award of enhanced damages is “predicated on the', 'assumption that Overhead Door willfully infringed,” OHD contends that Chamberlain’s request \\nfor enhanced damages likewise fails. (Id. at 10–11) (citations and quotations omitted). \\nChamberlain argues in response that it did not waive its motion under Rule 50(b) pursuant \\nto the Fifth Circuit’s de minimis exception to Rule 50. (Dkt. No. 635 at 1.) Chamberlain contends \\n \\n3 \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  31638\\nthat the Fifth Circuit “has found that when the purposes of Rule 50 are met, it ‘routinely excuses \\ntechnical noncompliance with the pre-submission requirement’ of filing a motion for JMOL before', 'the case is submitted to the jury ‘by invoking a de minimis exception to the rule.’” (Id. (citing \\nTaylor Publ’g Co. v. Jostens Inc., 216 F.3d 465, 472 (5th Cir. 2000)) (alterations omitted).)  \\nThe Court agrees with OHD that Chamberlain waived its willfulness argument by failing \\nto move under 50(a). (See Dkt. No. 615 at 226:9–16; 228:17–24.) A motion under Rule 50(b) is \\nnot allowed unless the movant sought relief on similar grounds under Rule 50(a) before the case \\nwas submitted to the jury. Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471, 485, n.5 (2008). The Court \\ndoes not find that the de minimis exception applies in this case.', 'While it is true that Chamberlain presented argument in response to OHD’s affirmative \\n50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law of no willfulness (see Dkt. No. 615 at 253:9–254:18), \\nthe Court finds that such does not have the same effect as affirmatively moving for judgment as a \\nmatter of law on willfulness. See Arsement v. Spinnaker Exploration Co., LLC, 400 F.3d 238, 247 \\n(5th Cir. 2005) (“If a party fails to raise an issue in its Rule 50(a)(1) motions at trial, it may not do \\nso in its post-trial Rule 50(b) motion.”); Adaptix, Inc. v. Alcatel-Lucent USA, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. \\nLEXIS 206065, at *13–14 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 30, 2016) (“Therefore, because Adaptix did not identify', 'lack of enablement as a specific ground in its Rule 50(a) motion, Adaptix waived its right to renew \\nit as part of its Rule 50(b) motion.”); Golden Hour Data Sys. v. emsCharts, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. \\nLEXIS 95640, at *6, 10 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 31, 2014) (“emsCharts altogether failed to raise the issues \\nof willful infringement or invalidity in its Rule 50(a) motion... emsCharts has waived its right to \\npresent the willful infringement [argument]…in its Rule 50(b) motion[.]”).1  \\n \\n1 See also Medisim Ltd. v. BestMed, LLC, 758 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“[W]e conclude that BestMed', 'forfeited its right to move for JMOL on anticipation” because “BestMed’s counsel made this statement in opposition \\nto Medisim’s motion for JMOL under Rule 50(a); BestMed never moved on its own for JMOL on anticipation before \\nthe case was submitted to the jury. Indeed, BestMed’s counsel conceded that BestMed ‘did not expressly say [that] \\n4 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 5 of 5 PageID #:  31639\\nAccordingly, because the Court finds that Chamberlain waived its argument as to \\nwillfulness, the Court need not reach the arguments on enhanced damages. Further, the Court finds', 'that even absent Chamberlain’s waiver, there was sufficient evidence before the jury to support \\ntheir finding of no willfulness and JMOL is not warranted in this instance. The Court addresses by \\nseparate order Chamberlain’s Motion for an Exceptional Case Finding and Attorneys’ Fees.  \\nIV. CONCLUSION \\nFor the reasons stated above, Chamberlain’s Motion (Dkt. No. 621) should be DENIED.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nwe cross-move for JMOL when they moved for JMOL on the anticipation issue.’”) (analyzing Second Circuit law) \\n(citations and quotations omitted).  \\n \\n5 \\n.\\n____________________________________\\nRODNEY  GILSTRAP\\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\\nSo ORDERED and SIGNED this 4th day of April, 2023.', 'Case 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 600   Filed 01/27/23   Page 1 of 9 PageID #:  23164\\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\\nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\\nMARSHALL DIVISION\\nTHE CHAMBERLAIN GROUP LLC, §\\nPlaintiff, §\\nv § CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:21-CV-00084-JRG\\nOVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION, GMI §\\nHOLDINGS INC., §\\nDefendants. §\\nVERDICT FORM\\nIn answering the following questions and completing this Verdict Form, you are to\\nfollow all the instructions that I have given you in the Court s Final Jury Instructions.

Overhead maintains its principal place of \\nbusiness within the Eastern District of Texas in Lewisville, \\nTexas. GMI maintains its headquarters in Ohio, but also \\nhas an engineering and testing center within the Northern \\nDistrict of Texas in Dallas, Texas.     \\n On March 10, 2021, Chamberlain brought this suit in \\nthe Eastern District of Texas, accusing several of OHD’s \\nbarrier opener products of infringing four Chamberlain pa-\\ntents related to movable barrier systems.  The next day, \\nChamberlain filed a second complaint against OHD in the \\nNorthern District of Texas, asserting infringement of the \\nsame patents against the same accused products.', 'OHD moved to transfer the Eastern Texas action pur-\\nsuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to Northern Texas.  OHD ar-\\ngued that “[a]ll of the Accused Products were designed, \\ntested, and built by Defendant [GMI], not by Defendant \\nOverhead,” and that “the engineers and individuals who \\nworked on the Accused Products and other likely witnesses \\nall live within 30–60 minutes of downtown Dallas.”  Mot. \\nat 5–6, Chamberlain Grp., LLC v. Overhead Door Corp., \\n2:21-cv-84 (E.D. Tex. May 4, 2021), ECF No. 21.   \\nOHD also argued that transfer would promote “con-\\nsistency and judicial efficiency.”  Id. at 11.  In support of \\nthat argument, OHD pointed to the second-filed Northern', 'Texas action brought by Chamberlain as well as OHD’s \\nown pending action against Chamberlain arising out of lit-\\nigation brought by Chamberlain in the International Trade \\nCommission. Overhead Door Corp. & GMI Holdings, Inc. v. \\nChamberlain Grp., Inc., No. 3:20-cv-1779 (the “-1779 ac-\\ntion”).  The -1779 action involves OHD’s infringement alle-\\ngations against Chamberlain products that are the subject \\nof OHD’s counterclaims in the Northern Texas action but \\nare not at issue in the instant litigation.   \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 3 of 5 PageID #:  3776\\nIN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\n 3 \\nIn its opposition, Chamberlain pointed out that OHD', 'had failed to identify any individuals by title or name who \\nreside in Northern Texas.  It also argued that potential wit-\\nnesses relevant to OHD’s license defense would likely come \\nfrom Lewisville, in the Eastern District of Texas.  Cham-\\nberlain further argued that transfer would not result in sig-\\nnificant judicial economy benefits.  In that regard, \\nChamberlain noted that it “intend[s] to dismiss th[e] \\nNorthern District action now that Defendants have an-\\nswered the Eastern District complaint,” Opp’n to Mot. to \\nTransfer at 13, Chamberlain Grp., LLC v. Overhead Door \\nCorp., 2:21-cv-84 (E.D. Tex. May 18, 2021), ECF No. 29, \\nand further noted that the -1779 action has been stayed', 'pending the outcome of the ITC litigation.    \\n On September 10, 2021, the district court denied \\nOHD’s motion.  The district court concluded that the court \\ncongestion factor weighed against transfer and that the re-\\nmaining factors were neutral.  In particular, the court \\nfound that OHD had failed to specifically identify any non-\\nparty witnesses who may testify at trial; OHD failed to pro-\\nvide sufficient information to determine whether the trans-\\nferee venue was more convenient for willing witnesses; and \\nthat there was not a substantial risk of duplicative litiga-\\ntion because OHD had moved to dismiss the second-filed \\nNorthern Texas action and because it was uncertain when', 'the -1779 action would again resume.  On balance, the dis-\\ntrict court determined that OHD had failed to establish \\nthat the transferee venue was clearly more convenient for \\nthe litigation, and therefore denied the motion.    \\nDISCUSSION \\nThe standard for mandamus relief is demanding.  A pe-\\n \\ntitioner must establish, among other things, that it has a \\nclear and indisputable legal right to relief.  Cheney v. U.S. \\nDist. Ct. for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 381 (2004) (citation omit-\\nted).  Under applicable Fifth Circuit law, on mandamus, we \\nreview only for “clear abuses of discretion that produce \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  3777\\n4', 'IN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\npatently erroneous results.”  In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc., \\n545 F.3d 304, 312 (5th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  We cannot say \\nthat OHD has met this standard.   \\n \\nThe district court found that OHD had failed to demon-\\nstrate that the Northern District of Texas was more con-\\nvenient for potential willing witnesses.  We see no clear \\nerror in the district court’s determination.  Chamberlain’s \\nchosen forum, located in the district where one of the de-\\nfendants is headquartered, appears to be convenient for at \\nleast some potential witnesses.  We have also held that a \\ndistrict court acts reasonably when it refuses to weigh the', 'willing witness factor in favor of transfer if unable to deter-\\nmine from the movant’s presentation of the factor that \\nthere are more potential witnesses in the transferee venue \\nthan the plaintiff’s chosen forum.  See In re Apple Inc., 743 \\nF.3d 1377, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Here, the district court\\nconcluded that OHD had failed to provide sufficient evi-\\ndence to make that determination.  And we are not pre-\\npared on mandamus to disturb that finding.\\nThe district court also reasonably determined that the \\nNorthern District of Texas did not have a comparative ad-\\nvantage with regard to compelling unwilling witnesses.  \\nOHD failed to identify any specific third-party potential', 'witnesses in its motion that may need to be compelled.  \\nMoreover, a district court in the Eastern District of Texas \\ncan subpoena a person to attend a trial, hearing, or dispo-\\nsition within the state of Texas where the person resides, \\nis employed, or regularly transacts business in person, if \\nthe person is commanded to attend a trial and would not \\nincur a substantial expense.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \\n45(c)(1)(B)(ii).  Because the denial of OHD’s motion to \\ntransfer here would not result in a substantial burden on \\nwitnesses required to travel from Dallas to Marshall, \\nTexas, OHD has not shown that the compulsory-process \\nfactor clearly weighs in favor of transfer.', 'Case 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 5 of 5 PageID #:  3778\\nIN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\n 5 \\n OHD has also not made a compelling showing on the \\nother factors.  OHD contends that the district court erred \\nin not weighing the local interest factor in favor of transfer \\nbecause the accused products were designed and tested in \\nDallas, Texas and none of the underlying events giving rise \\nto this infringement action occurred in the Eastern District \\nof Texas.  But OHD failed to raise any specific argument \\nthat the local interest factor favored transfer in its motion, \\nand a district court does not err, let alone, clearly so, by not', 'accepting an argument it was not properly asked to con-\\nsider.  We also cannot say that OHD has shown that judi-\\ncial economy would be clearly served by transferring the \\ncase here.  The district court plausibly found that OHD had \\nnot shown a significant risk of duplicative suits between \\nthe parties because Chamberlain moved to dismiss or \\ntransfer the Northern Texas action and because the -1779 \\naction involved different patents and it was uncertain as to \\nwhen the stay of that litigation would be lifted.   \\nAccordingly, \\nIT IS ORDERED THAT: \\nThe petition is denied. \\nDecember 07, 2021 \\nDate \\nFOR THE COURT \\n/s/ Peter R.

A party that receives a document produced in a format specified above\\nmay make a reasonable request to receive the document in its native format, and upon receipt\\nof such a request, the producing party shall produce the document in its native format.\\nE. No Backup Restoration Required.

A disjunctive combination of multiple words or phrases (e.g., “computer” or “system”)\\nbroadens the search, and thus each word or phrase shall count as a separate search term unless they\\nare variants of the same word.

Having considered the Motion, and for the reasons stated herein, \\nthe Court finds that it should be DENIED. \\nI. \\nBACKGROUND \\nChamberlain filed a Complaint on March 10, 2021, alleging infringement by Defendants \\nOverhead Door Corporation and GMI Holdings Inc. (collectively, “Defendants” or “OHD”) of \\nU.S. Patent Nos. 8,587,404 (the “’404 patent”); 9,644,416 (the “’416 patent”); 7,852,212 (the \\n“’212 patent”); and 8,144,011 (the “’011 patent”) (collectively, the “Original Asserted Patents”). \\n(Dkt. No. 1.) Chamberlain accused of infringement certain garage door openers sold by \\nDefendants. (See generally id.)  \\nAfter a jury trial was held on the Original Asserted Patents in March of 2022, a new trial \\nwas awarded only as to the ’404 patent. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 356, 386.) \\nA trial on the ’404 patent commenced on January 23, 2023. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 595, 596, 597, \\n598, 602, 610, 611, 612, 614, 615, 616.) On January 27, 2023, the jury returned a verdict finding \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  31636\\nthat Defendants infringed Claims 4 and 20 of the ’404 patent, that Defendants’ infringement was \\nnot willful, and that the Asserted Claims are not invalid as obvious or for improper inventorship. \\n(Dkt. No. 599.) The jury awarded $43.4 million in damages, $2.7 million of which represents a \\nrunning royalty. (Id.)  \\nChamberlain filed the instant Motion on March 2, 2023, urging the Court to overturn the \\njury’s finding of no willfulness pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). (Dkt. No. 621.)  \\nII. \\nLEGAL STANDARD \\na. Judgment as a Matter of Law \\n“Judgment as a matter of law is proper when ‘a reasonable jury would not have a legally \\nsufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.’” Abraham v. Alpha Chi Omega, 708 \\nF.3d 614, 620 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)). The non-moving party must identify \\n“substantial evidence” to support its positions. TGIP, Inc. v. AT&T Corp., 527 F. Supp. 2d 561, \\n569 (E.D. Tex. 2007). “Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant \\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.” Eli Lilly & Co. \\nv. Aradigm Corp., 376 F.3d 1352, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  \\n“The Fifth Circuit views all evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict and will \\nreverse a jury’s verdict only if the evidence points so overwhelmingly in favor of one party that \\nreasonable jurors could not arrive at any contrary conclusion.” Core Wireless Licensing S.A.R.L. \\nv. LG Elecs., Inc., 880 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing Bagby Elevator Co. v. Schindler \\nElevator Corp., 609 F.3d 768, 773 (5th Cir. 2010)). A court must “resolve all conflicting evidence \\nin favor of [the verdict] and refrain from weighing the evidence or making credibility \\ndeterminations.” Gomez v. St. Jude Med. Diag. Div. Inc., 442 F.3d 919, 937–38 (5th Cir. 2006). \\n \\n2 \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 3 of 5 PageID #:  31637\\nRule 50(a)(2) requires the moving party, when moving for JMOL before the case is \\nsubmitted to the jury, to “specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts that entitle the \\nmovant to the judgment.” Generally, a party who fails to present a Rule 50(a) motion on an issue \\nprior to the close of evidence waives both its right to present a Rule 50(b) motion after judgment \\nand its right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b); Navigant \\nConsulting, Inc. v. Wilkinson, 508 F.3d 277, 288 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Flowers v. S. Reg’l \\nPhysician Servs. Inc., 247 F.3d 229, 238). \\nIII. DISCUSSION \\nChamberlain urges that the evidence presented at trial does not support the jury’s finding \\nthat OHD did not willfully infringe the ’404 patent. (Dkt. No. 621 at 1.) Chamberlain also argues \\nthat “enhanced damages are warranted not only due to OHD’s willful infringement, but because \\nof its repeated litigation misconduct, which is outlined in detail in Chamberlain’s Motion for \\nSanctions (Dkt. No. 348) and Chamberlain’s Motion for an Exceptional Case Finding and \\nAttorneys’ Fees (Dkt. No. 620).” (Id.)  \\nOHD argues that Chamberlain waived this argument because it “failed to move for \\njudgment as a matter of law on the issue of willfulness before submission of the case to the jury \\nunder Rule 50(a).” (Dkt. No. 631 at 1.) OHD also contends that Chamberlain’s argument fails on \\nthe merits because there was substantial evidence at trial supporting the jury’s finding of no willful \\ninfringement. (Id. at 4–9.) Further, since an award of enhanced damages is “predicated on the \\nassumption that Overhead Door willfully infringed,” OHD contends that Chamberlain’s request \\nfor enhanced damages likewise fails. (Id. at 10–11) (citations and quotations omitted). \\nChamberlain argues in response that it did not waive its motion under Rule 50(b) pursuant \\nto the Fifth Circuit’s de minimis exception to Rule 50. (Dkt. No. 635 at 1.) Chamberlain contends \\n \\n3 \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  31638\\nthat the Fifth Circuit “has found that when the purposes of Rule 50 are met, it ‘routinely excuses \\ntechnical noncompliance with the pre-submission requirement’ of filing a motion for JMOL before \\nthe case is submitted to the jury ‘by invoking a de minimis exception to the rule.’” (Id. (citing \\nTaylor Publ’g Co. v. Jostens Inc., 216 F.3d 465, 472 (5th Cir. 2000)) (alterations omitted).)  \\nThe Court agrees with OHD that Chamberlain waived its willfulness argument by failing \\nto move under 50(a). (See Dkt. No. 615 at 226:9–16; 228:17–24.) A motion under Rule 50(b) is \\nnot allowed unless the movant sought relief on similar grounds under Rule 50(a) before the case \\nwas submitted to the jury. Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471, 485, n.5 (2008). The Court \\ndoes not find that the de minimis exception applies in this case.  \\nWhile it is true that Chamberlain presented argument in response to OHD’s affirmative \\n50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law of no willfulness (see Dkt. No. 615 at 253:9–254:18), \\nthe Court finds that such does not have the same effect as affirmatively moving for judgment as a \\nmatter of law on willfulness. See Arsement v. Spinnaker Exploration Co., LLC, 400 F.3d 238, 247 \\n(5th Cir. 2005) (“If a party fails to raise an issue in its Rule 50(a)(1) motions at trial, it may not do \\nso in its post-trial Rule 50(b) motion.”); Adaptix, Inc. v. Alcatel-Lucent USA, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. \\nLEXIS 206065, at *13–14 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 30, 2016) (“Therefore, because Adaptix did not identify \\nlack of enablement as a specific ground in its Rule 50(a) motion, Adaptix waived its right to renew \\nit as part of its Rule 50(b) motion.”); Golden Hour Data Sys. v. emsCharts, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. \\nLEXIS 95640, at *6, 10 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 31, 2014) (“emsCharts altogether failed to raise the issues \\nof willful infringement or invalidity in its Rule 50(a) motion... emsCharts has waived its right to \\npresent the willful infringement [argument]…in its Rule 50(b) motion[.]”).1  \\n \\n1 See also Medisim Ltd. v. BestMed, LLC, 758 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“[W]e conclude that BestMed \\nforfeited its right to move for JMOL on anticipation” because “BestMed’s counsel made this statement in opposition \\nto Medisim’s motion for JMOL under Rule 50(a); BestMed never moved on its own for JMOL on anticipation before \\nthe case was submitted to the jury. Indeed, BestMed’s counsel conceded that BestMed ‘did not expressly say [that] \\n4 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 655   Filed 04/04/23   Page 5 of 5 PageID #:  31639\\nAccordingly, because the Court finds that Chamberlain waived its argument as to \\nwillfulness, the Court need not reach the arguments on enhanced damages. Further, the Court finds \\nthat even absent Chamberlain’s waiver, there was sufficient evidence before the jury to support \\ntheir finding of no willfulness and JMOL is not warranted in this instance. The Court addresses by \\nseparate order Chamberlain’s Motion for an Exceptional Case Finding and Attorneys’ Fees.  \\nIV. CONCLUSION \\nFor the reasons stated above, Chamberlain’s Motion (Dkt. No. 621) should be DENIED.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nwe cross-move for JMOL when they moved for JMOL on the anticipation issue.’”) (analyzing Second Circuit law) \\n(citations and quotations omitted).  \\n \\n5 \\n.\\n____________________________________\\nRODNEY  GILSTRAP\\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\\nSo ORDERED and SIGNED this 4th day of April, 2023.\\n\\x0c', \"Case 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 600   Filed 01/27/23   Page 1 of 9 PageID #:  23164\\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\\nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\\nMARSHALL DIVISION\\nTHE CHAMBERLAIN GROUP LLC, §\\nPlaintiff, §\\nv § CIVIL ACTION NO. 2:21-CV-00084-JRG\\nOVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION, GMI §\\nHOLDINGS INC., §\\nDefendants. §\\nVERDICT FORM\\nIn answering the following questions and completing this Verdict Form, you are to\\nfollow all the instructions that I have given you in the Court s Final Jury Instructions.

The Chamberlain Group LLC opposes.  Be-\\ncause the district court did not clearly abuse its discretion \\nin denying transfer, we deny the petition.  \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  3775\\n2 \\nIN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\nBACKGROUND \\n Overhead, and its subsidiary, GMI, are in the business \\nof manufacturing and selling garage and other barrier door \\nopening devices.  Overhead maintains its principal place of \\nbusiness within the Eastern District of Texas in Lewisville, \\nTexas. GMI maintains its headquarters in Ohio, but also \\nhas an engineering and testing center within the Northern \\nDistrict of Texas in Dallas, Texas.     \\n On March 10, 2021, Chamberlain brought this suit in \\nthe Eastern District of Texas, accusing several of OHD’s \\nbarrier opener products of infringing four Chamberlain pa-\\ntents related to movable barrier systems.  The next day, \\nChamberlain filed a second complaint against OHD in the \\nNorthern District of Texas, asserting infringement of the \\nsame patents against the same accused products.   \\n OHD moved to transfer the Eastern Texas action pur-\\nsuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to Northern Texas.  OHD ar-\\ngued that “[a]ll of the Accused Products were designed, \\ntested, and built by Defendant [GMI], not by Defendant \\nOverhead,” and that “the engineers and individuals who \\nworked on the Accused Products and other likely witnesses \\nall live within 30–60 minutes of downtown Dallas.”  Mot. \\nat 5–6, Chamberlain Grp., LLC v. Overhead Door Corp., \\n2:21-cv-84 (E.D. Tex. May 4, 2021), ECF No. 21.   \\nOHD also argued that transfer would promote “con-\\nsistency and judicial efficiency.”  Id. at 11.  In support of \\nthat argument, OHD pointed to the second-filed Northern \\nTexas action brought by Chamberlain as well as OHD’s \\nown pending action against Chamberlain arising out of lit-\\nigation brought by Chamberlain in the International Trade \\nCommission. Overhead Door Corp. & GMI Holdings, Inc. v. \\nChamberlain Grp., Inc., No. 3:20-cv-1779 (the “-1779 ac-\\ntion”).  The -1779 action involves OHD’s infringement alle-\\ngations against Chamberlain products that are the subject \\nof OHD’s counterclaims in the Northern Texas action but \\nare not at issue in the instant litigation.   \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 3 of 5 PageID #:  3776\\nIN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\n 3 \\nIn its opposition, Chamberlain pointed out that OHD \\n \\nhad failed to identify any individuals by title or name who \\nreside in Northern Texas.  It also argued that potential wit-\\nnesses relevant to OHD’s license defense would likely come \\nfrom Lewisville, in the Eastern District of Texas.  Cham-\\nberlain further argued that transfer would not result in sig-\\nnificant judicial economy benefits.  In that regard, \\nChamberlain noted that it “intend[s] to dismiss th[e] \\nNorthern District action now that Defendants have an-\\nswered the Eastern District complaint,” Opp’n to Mot. to \\nTransfer at 13, Chamberlain Grp., LLC v. Overhead Door \\nCorp., 2:21-cv-84 (E.D. Tex. May 18, 2021), ECF No. 29, \\nand further noted that the -1779 action has been stayed \\npending the outcome of the ITC litigation.    \\n On September 10, 2021, the district court denied \\nOHD’s motion.  The district court concluded that the court \\ncongestion factor weighed against transfer and that the re-\\nmaining factors were neutral.  In particular, the court \\nfound that OHD had failed to specifically identify any non-\\nparty witnesses who may testify at trial; OHD failed to pro-\\nvide sufficient information to determine whether the trans-\\nferee venue was more convenient for willing witnesses; and \\nthat there was not a substantial risk of duplicative litiga-\\ntion because OHD had moved to dismiss the second-filed \\nNorthern Texas action and because it was uncertain when \\nthe -1779 action would again resume.  On balance, the dis-\\ntrict court determined that OHD had failed to establish \\nthat the transferee venue was clearly more convenient for \\nthe litigation, and therefore denied the motion.    \\nDISCUSSION \\nThe standard for mandamus relief is demanding.  A pe-\\n \\ntitioner must establish, among other things, that it has a \\nclear and indisputable legal right to relief.  Cheney v. U.S. \\nDist. Ct. for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 381 (2004) (citation omit-\\nted).  Under applicable Fifth Circuit law, on mandamus, we \\nreview only for “clear abuses of discretion that produce \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  3777\\n4 \\nIN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\npatently erroneous results.”  In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc., \\n545 F.3d 304, 312 (5th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  We cannot say \\nthat OHD has met this standard.   \\n \\nThe district court found that OHD had failed to demon-\\nstrate that the Northern District of Texas was more con-\\nvenient for potential willing witnesses.  We see no clear \\nerror in the district court’s determination.  Chamberlain’s \\nchosen forum, located in the district where one of the de-\\nfendants is headquartered, appears to be convenient for at \\nleast some potential witnesses.  We have also held that a \\ndistrict court acts reasonably when it refuses to weigh the \\nwilling witness factor in favor of transfer if unable to deter-\\nmine from the movant’s presentation of the factor that \\nthere are more potential witnesses in the transferee venue \\nthan the plaintiff’s chosen forum.  See In re Apple Inc., 743 \\nF.3d 1377, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Here, the district court\\nconcluded that OHD had failed to provide sufficient evi-\\ndence to make that determination.  And we are not pre-\\npared on mandamus to disturb that finding.\\nThe district court also reasonably determined that the \\nNorthern District of Texas did not have a comparative ad-\\nvantage with regard to compelling unwilling witnesses.  \\nOHD failed to identify any specific third-party potential \\nwitnesses in its motion that may need to be compelled.  \\nMoreover, a district court in the Eastern District of Texas \\ncan subpoena a person to attend a trial, hearing, or dispo-\\nsition within the state of Texas where the person resides, \\nis employed, or regularly transacts business in person, if \\nthe person is commanded to attend a trial and would not \\nincur a substantial expense.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \\n45(c)(1)(B)(ii).  Because the denial of OHD’s motion to \\ntransfer here would not result in a substantial burden on \\nwitnesses required to travel from Dallas to Marshall, \\nTexas, OHD has not shown that the compulsory-process \\nfactor clearly weighs in favor of transfer.  \\n\\x0c\\n\\x0c\\nCase 2:21-cv-00084-JRG   Document 147   Filed 12/07/21   Page 5 of 5 PageID #:  3778\\nIN RE: OVERHEAD DOOR CORPORATION \\n 5 \\n OHD has also not made a compelling showing on the \\nother factors.  OHD contends that the district court erred \\nin not weighing the local interest factor in favor of transfer \\nbecause the accused products were designed and tested in \\nDallas, Texas and none of the underlying events giving rise \\nto this infringement action occurred in the Eastern District \\nof Texas.  But OHD failed to raise any specific argument \\nthat the local interest factor favored transfer in its motion, \\nand a district court does not err, let alone, clearly so, by not \\naccepting an argument it was not properly asked to con-\\nsider.  We also cannot say that OHD has shown that judi-\\ncial economy would be clearly served by transferring the \\ncase here.  The district court plausibly found that OHD had \\nnot shown a significant risk of duplicative suits between \\nthe parties because Chamberlain moved to dismiss or \\ntransfer the Northern Texas action and because the -1779 \\naction involved different patents and it was uncertain as to \\nwhen the stay of that litigation would be lifted.   \\nAccordingly, \\nIT IS ORDERED THAT: \\nThe petition is denied. \\nDecember 07, 2021 \\nDate \\nFOR THE COURT \\n/s/ Peter R.

The parties may jointly agree to modify this limit without the court’s\\nleave.  The court shall consider contested requests for additional or fewer custodians per producing\\nparty, upon showing a distinct need based on the size, complexity, and issues of this specific case. \\n9. Each requesting party shall limit its e-mail production requests to a total of ten search terms per\\ncustodian per party.  The parties may jointly agree to modify this limit without the court’s leave.  \\nThe court shall consider contested requests for additional or fewer search terms per custodian, upon\\nshowing a distinct need based on the size, complexity, and issues of this specific case.  The search\\nterms shall be narrowly tailored to particular issues. Indiscriminate terms, such as the producing\\ncompany’s name or its product name, are inappropriate unless combined with narrowing search\\ncriteria that sufficiently reduce the risk of overproduction.  A conjunctive combination of multiple\\nwords or phrases (e.g., “computer” and “system”) narrows the search and shall count as a single\\nsearch term.  A disjunctive combination of multiple words or phrases (e.g., “computer” or “system”)\\nbroadens the search, and thus each word or phrase shall count as a separate search term unless they\\nare variants of the same word.  Use of narrowing search criteria (e.g., “and,” “but not,” “w/x”) is\\nencouraged to limit the production and shall be considered when determining whether to shift costs\\nfor disproportionate discovery. \\n10. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 502(d), the inadvertent production of a privileged or work\\nproduct protected ESI is not a waiver in the pending case or in any other federal or state proceeding.\\n11.

In discussion with the parties, the court granted part two of the motion: defendant and the intervening insurance companies may have until August 24, 2015 to file dispositive motions based solely on their dispute over choice of counsel. The court allowed this extension mainly to provide these parties the extra time they requested to attempt to resolve this particular dispute, either on a substantive level or on a discovery level. The court denied the first half of defendant's motion without prejudice. If the parties cannot resolve their discovery disputes on this issue quickly and efficiently, then they must re-present their lingering disputes to the court ASAP so that they get a ruling before August 24, 2015. In approaching the remaining disputes, the parties should take to heart the court's observations and admonitions regarding the cost/benefit ratio in play here.

Plaintiffs' motion 179 to withdraw their first motion 170 to extend expert disclosure deadlines is granted. Plaintiffs' unopposed motion 180 to extend a set of dates in the preliminary pretrial conference order is granted in part. All of the proposed extensions are acceptable and accepted with one exception: the motion to certify a class must be fully briefed and under advisal to the court not later than September 18, 2015. This means that the parties cannot proceed on the 6 week/3 week response/reply briefing schedule they originally proposed. On whatever day plaintiffs file their motion to certify a class, defendant gets this much time to respond: either 2/3 of the time from the motion filing date date until September 18, 2015, or 28 days, whichever is longer. Any remaining time after the response until September 18, 2015 is available for plaintiffs' reply. Even then, the parties should not expect an expedited ruling on a class certification request, which means that in the last three months before trial, counsel will be busy. That said, the February 1, 2016 trial date is not moving as a result of these extensions. This case already is a year old and it will be almost two years old when it is tried. This is a generous schedule for a class action lawsuit in this court, so from the court's perspective, the parties have had and will have more than sufficient time to do what they need to do in this lawsuit.

Plaintiffs' unopposed motion 180 to extend a set of dates in the preliminary pretrial conference order is granted in part\", \". All of the proposed extensions are acceptable and accepted with one exception: the motion to certify a class must be fully briefed and under advisal to the court not later than September 18, 2015. This means that the parties cannot proceed on the 6 week/3 week response/reply briefing schedule they originally proposed. On whatever day plaintiffs file their motion to certify a class, defendant gets this much time to respond: either 2/3 of the time from the motion filing date date until September 18, 2015, or 28 days, whichever is longer. Any remaining time after the response until September 18, 2015 is available for plaintiffs' reply\", \". Even then, the parties should not expect an expedited ruling on a class certification request, which means that in the last three months before trial, counsel will be busy. That said, the February 1, 2016 trial date is not moving as a result of these extensions. This case already is a year old and it will be almost two years old when it is tried. This is a generous schedule for a class action lawsuit in this court, so from the court's perspective, the parties have had and will have more than sufficient time to do what they need to do in this lawsuit.

Dkt. #233.

Before the court is plaintiffs’ motion for\\nreconsideration of the court’s ruling on the misrepresentation claim on the ground that\\nplaintiffs have discovered new evidence in support of it.  Dkt. #367.  I am denying the\\nmotion because plaintiffs have failed to show the materiality of the new evidence or how it\\nwould produce a new result on summary judgment.\\nOPINION\\nPlaintiffs have filed their motion under Fed. R. Civ. Rule 60(b)(2), which allows a\\ndistrict court to “relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding” on the\\nground of “newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been\\ndiscovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b).”  A successful Rule 60(b)(2)\\nmotion has five prerequisites:  (1) the evidence must have been discovered after the entry\\nof judgment; (2) due diligence on the part of the movant to discover the new evidence has\\nbeen shown or may be inferred; (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching; (4)\\nthe evidence is material; and (5) the evidence is such that a new [ruling] would probably\\nproduce a new result.  Jones v. Lincoln Electric Co., 188 F.3d 709, 732 (7th Cir.1999).  A\\nmotion under Rule 60(b)(2) must be made “within a reasonable time” and “no more than\\na year after the entry of judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.”  Fed. R. Civ. P.\\n60(c)(1).  \\n2\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 384   Filed: 11/06/15   Page 3 of 6\\nAs an initial matter, I note that it is unclear whether plaintiffs’ motion should be\\nconsidered a motion for reconsideration instead of a Rule 60 motion because judgment has\\nnot been entered yet in this case.  Although I entered an order dismissing plaintiffs’ § 100.18\\nclaim, defendant moved only for partial summary judgment and several of plaintiffs’ claims\\nare proceeding to trial.  Defendant does not address the applicability of Rule 60 or the\\nstandard of review.  In any event, the result is the same.  The “new” evidence does not save\\nthe claim brought by Groome and Samuels. \\nUnder Wis. Stat.§ 100.18(1), plaintiffs must demonstrate three elements: (1)\\ndefendant made a representation to the public with the intent to induce an obligation; (2)\\nthe representation was untrue, deceptive or misleading; and (3) the representation caused\\nplaintiffs a pecuniary loss.  K & S Tool & Die Corp. v. Perfection Machinery Sales, Inc.,\\n2007 WI 70, ¶ 19, 301 Wis. 2d 109, 732 N.W.2d 792.  In the summary judgment order,\\nI found that plaintiffs had failed to identify any specific factual representation that\\ndefendant had made with the intent to induce plaintiffs Groome and Samuels to purchase\\nits windows, as required under Wisconsin law.  United Concrete & Const., Inc. v.\\nRed-D-Mix Concrete, Inc., 2013 WI 72, ¶¶ 25 and 28, 349 Wis. 2d 587, 606-07, 836\\nN.W.2d 807, 816-17 (defendant must make representation about nature or quality of\\nproduct that is specific enough that its truth or falsity can be determined).  I decided that\\ndefendant could not be held liable for vague statements by defendant’s distributor that\\ndefendant’s windows were “high quality” and “American made.”  Id. at ¶ 25 (seller not liable\\n3\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 384   Filed: 11/06/15   Page 4 of 6\\nfor “puffery” under § 100.18 because such exaggerations convey only an opinion and are not\\ncapable of being substantiated or refuted). \\nPlaintiffs now state that they have new evidence that defendant made false\\nrepresentations to the public, including evidence that defendant tested only certain windows\\n(“ringers”) to pass certification, misdirected class members regarding the “water preservation\\ncapabilities” of its windows and installation instructions and artfully worded materials to\\nfalsely assure class members, builders and installers that its windows complied with building\\ncodes.  In support of their contentions, they cite the following evidence:\\n• Kenneth Wilcox, a research and development certification engineer for\\ndefendant, admitted in his deposition that “very few Kolbe windows that\\ncame off the line were used for certification testing” and that “R&D\\ncertification testing procedure had to be artfully worded so it doesn't\\nappear we only test ringers.”  Dkt. #289 at 153-58. \\n• Wilcox testified that design professionals and installers are not limited to\\nfollowing Kolbe’s installation instructions verbatim.  Id. at 169.  (Plaintiffs\\nstate without support that purchasers are required to follow these\\ninstructions.)\\n• George Digman, defendant’s director of research and development,\\ntestified that there are different standards for field testing and length of\\nservice after a window has been installed.  Dkt. #355 at 97.  \\n• Digman stated that defendant told customers that installers had to verify\\nthat the windows had been installed according to defendant’s instructions,\\nbut defendant had no official mechanism for installers to do this.  Id. at\\n126-28.                  \\n• Jerry Budnik, a service manager for defendant, stated in a 2007 internal\\nemail to a research and development manager that defendant was receiving\\nan increasing number of complaints about rotting windows and that “we\\nreally need to start looking at our decaying problem.”  Dkt. #369, exh. 1. \\n4\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 384   Filed: 11/06/15   Page 5 of 6\\nContrary to plaintiffs’ contentions, this “new evidence” does not cure all of the\\ndeficiencies identified in the summary judgment order, and some of it does not seem to\\nrelate to any misrepresentation allegedly made by defendant.  Although plaintiffs submit\\ntestimony from two Kolbe employees who suggest that defendant may have acted in a\\nmisleading manner, plaintiffs do not identify the particular misrepresentations that they\\nbelieve defendant made to any member of the public concerning the certification testing,\\n“water preservation capabilities” and building code compliance of its windows.  They have\\nadduced no evidence relating to when, where or how defendant made the misleading\\nstatements or representations.  Plaintiffs provide a bit more detail with respect to what\\ndefendant said or required concerning installation, but again, they fail to adduce any\\nevidence of the specific installation instructions given to the public.  They state only\\ngenerally that defendant includes instructions with each unit sold that must be followed to\\nfile a valid warranty claim.\\nFurther, plaintiffs still have not satisfied the third element of the § 100.18 claim\\nbecause they have not explained how defendant’s alleged misrepresentations and false\\nstatements caused pecuniary loss to plaintiffs Groome and Samuels.  K & S Tool & Die,\\n2007 WI 70 at ¶ 35 (causal connection required between untrue, deceptive or misleading\\nrepresentation and pecuniary loss).  Groome and Samuels did not identify any specific\\nstatements that they saw regarding certification, water preservation, building codes or\\ninstallation or link them to the loss they sustained.

It manufactured the defective\\nwindows at issue in this case.\\nPlaintiff Marie Lohr is a resident of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, who had approximately\\n30 Kolbe aluminum-cladded windows installed when her home was built in 2001.  Within\\nmonths of installation, the windows developed condensation and the wood on all of the\\nwindows began to rot and deteriorate.  In late 2010, defendant inspected and replaced 26\\nof the windows with new, aluminum-cladded Kolbe windows.  In or around the summer of\\n2013, the 26 replacement windows began to discolor, rot and develop mold.  In or around\\nthe winter of 2013, the windows also developed significant condensation.\\n2\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 3 of 8\\nOPINION\\nPlaintiffs alleged in their complaint common law and statutory claims that defendant\\nbreached express and implied warranties, negligently misrepresented the condition of the\\nwindows they sold, were negligent in the manufacture and design of the windows, made\\nfraudulent representations and have been unjustly enriched.  In addition, they alleged the\\nfour counts under Wisconsin’s Home Improvement Practices Act, Wis. Admin. Code §§\\nATCP 110.01-.09, that are at issue on defendant’s motion to dismiss.  \\nThe Home Improvement Practices Act applies to sellers of home improvements, as\\ndefined in § ATCP 110.01.   Under the Home Improvement Practices Act, a “seller” is\\ndefined as “a person engaged in the business of making or selling home improvements.”  The\\nterm “includes corporations, partnerships, associations, and any other form of business\\norganization or entity and their officers, representatives, agents, and employees.”  § ATCP\\n101.01(5).  “Home improvement” is defined in § ATCP 101.01(2) as:\\nthe remodeling, altering, repairing, painting, or modernizing of\\nresidential or non-commercial property, or the making of additions\\nthereto, and includes, but is not limited to, the construction,\\ninstallation, replacement, improvement, or repair of driveways,\\nsidewalks, swimming pools, terraces, patios, landscaping, fences,\\nporches, garages, basements and basement waterproofing, fire\\nprotection devices, heating and air conditioning equipment, water\\nsofteners, heaters and purifiers, wall-to-wall carpeting or attached or\\ninlaid floor coverings, and other changes, repairs, or improvements\\nmade in or on, attached to, or forming a part of, the residential or\\nnon-commercial property.  The term extends to the conversion of\\nexisting commercial structures into residential or non-commercial\\nproperty.  “Home improvement” does not include the construction of\\na new residence or the major renovation of an existing structure.\\nAccording to the legislative history of Chapter ATCP 110, Wisconsin has had\\n3\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 4 of 8\\nlegislation since at least 1953 directed at persons and companies engaging in misleading or\\ndeceptive sales practices.  In the earliest examples, the regulation addressed persons using\\nmisleading practices when selling roofing and siding at retail, such as telling a prospective\\ncustomer that his house would serve as a “model home” for which he will be paid a\\ncommission or that he was being offered a special price.  Dkt. #44, Exh. B, Dept. of\\nAgriculture, In the Matter of the Codification of Rules, Dkt. No. 407, General Order 153,\\nSept. 3, 1953.  See also id., Exh. A at 3, “Findings of Department of Agriculture”:  “The evils\\nthat have developed [in the sale of roofing and siding] are due to unscrupulous salesmen\\nselling at retail and who make statements and representations which have the capacity to and\\ndo tend to mislead and deceive the prospective customer.”  Chapter ATCP 110 is the current\\nversion of the regulations, expanded to cover not just sellers of roofing and siding, but any\\nperson in the business of making or selling home improvements who engages in misleading\\nor deceptive sales practices. \\nThe question at issue is a purely legal one: does the Act apply to persons like\\ndefendant who sell windows but are not alleged to have installed them?   Defendant\\ncontends that it does not because the Home Improvement Practices Act was written to\\nregulate the entities constructing,  installing, repairing, remodeling and modernizing\\nresidential properties, not at the entities that provide the products used in those services.\\nDefendant notes that when the Act defines defining “home improvements,” it uses verbs\\nrather than nouns, talking in terms of work to be performed, such as altering, repairing,\\nmaking additions to residential or non-commercial property and installing and replacing\\n4\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 5 of 8\\nspecific items, along with “other changes, repairs or improvements made in or on, attached\\nto, or forming a part of, the residential or non-commercial property.”  It says nothing about\\nthe manufacturers or sellers of the products that a person making or selling home\\nimprovements may install or replace on the property as part of the remodeling process.  \\nDefendant points out that other provisions of the Act support its position that the\\nAct does not apply to manufacturers: (1) under § ATCP 110.04(1), sellers are required to\\nprovide all warranty documents to the buyer at the time the buyer enters into the home\\nimprovement contract, with the exception of manufacturers’ product warranties, which may\\nbe provided at the time of installation; (2) under § ATCP 110.05(2)(b), the home\\nimprovement contract must describe the work to be done and the principal products and\\nmaterials to be used, which defendant says indicates that the rule targets the contractor, who\\nmust identify the work to be done and the products and materials to be used or installed,\\nwhereas a manufacturer such as defendant is not doing any work or installing anything; (3)\\nunder § ATCP 110.07(2)(c), a buyer whose payments have been used to purchase materials\\nfor the home improvement may require the  seller to deliver any undelivered materials to the\\nhome improvement site, which is a further indication that the manufacturers of products are\\ntreated differently from contractors using the products.   Finally, it notes that no Wisconsin\\ncourt has held that a manufacturer is a “seller” under the Act.\\nPlaintiffs view the issue differently, arguing that the definition of “seller” extends to\\nentities that merely sell home improvements and that a window is clearly a “home\\nimprovement.”  They cite a number of cases, none of which provide support for their\\nposition.  Rohrer v. Willis, 2003 WI App 42, 260 Wis. 2d 602, 658 N.W.2d 88, an\\n5\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 6 of 8\\nunpublished decision, concerned a suit by homeowners against the members of the\\ncorporation with which they had contracted for the installation of windows and which had\\nfailed to pay the manufacturer for the windows it installed.  The court of appeals noted that\\nthe manufacturer had placed a lien on the homeowners’ residence for the amount owed for\\nthe windows but the lien was essentially irrelevant to the question before it so the court had\\nno reason to identify the legal basis for it.  Plaintiffs concede that Wis. Stat. § 779.036(1)\\nwould have provided a legal basis for the lien and do not claim that it would have been\\nproper under Chapter ATCP 110.  In Complete Plumbing, Inc. v. Follett, 2012 WI App 73,\\n342 Wis. 2d 251, 816 N.W.2d 352, another unpublished opinion, and Stuart v. Weisflog’s\\nShowroom Gallery, Inc., 2008 WI 22, 308 Wis. 2d 103, 746 N.W.2d 762, the courts never\\nhad occasion to address the question whether the Act would apply to a manufacturer of a\\nproduct not involved in the product’s installation because both suits were brought against\\ncontracting entities.  In Jackson v. DeWitt, 224 Wis. 2d 877, 592 N.W.2d 262 (Ct. App.\\n1999), the question was the construction of a contractor’s assignment of his interest in a\\nhome improvement contract; the only reference to the Act was the court of appeals’ holding\\nthat under § ATCP 110.06, the assignee of a home improvement contract takes the contract\\nsubject to the claims and defenses of the consumer without regard to negotiability. \\nIn further support of their position that the Act applies to defendant, plaintiffs cite\\nanother unpublished Wisconsin Court of Appeals case, American Total Security, Inc. v.\\nGeneva Schultz Living Trust, 2007 WI App 1, 298 Wis. 2d 248, 726 N.W.2d 357, for the\\nproposition that “windows are a feature encompassed within the definition of ‘home\\nimprovement.’” Plts.’ Br., dkt. #58, at 4 n.1.  Although the court of appeals found that\\n6\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 7 of 8\\nAmerican Total Security’s contract with defendant for the purchase and installation of\\nwindows violated § ATCP 110.05(2) (“Home improvement contract requirements”),  id. at\\n¶¶ 3, 8, it never said that “windows are encompassed within the definition of ‘home\\nimprovement.’”  In fact, it never explained the grounds for its finding that American Total\\nSecurity was a covered “seller”; instead, it merely adopted the finding it had made when the\\ncase was before it at an earlier stage.  (No copy of that earlier decision is available.) \\nPresumably, at that time, it explained why it found that American Total Security was\\ncovered under § ATCP 110.01(5).  That would be a proper conclusion in a situation in\\nwhich the defendant had contracted with American Total Security for both the windows and\\ntheir installation.  Whether the state court would have reached the same result if the case\\nhad not involved installation of the windows is impossible to determine.  \\nPlaintiffs argue that an Act such as Chapter ATCP 110 should be construed broadly\\nto effectuate its purposes of protecting homeowners from unscrupulous manufacturers as\\nwell as sellers using deceptive practices to defraud persons seeking home improvements. \\nThat argument is unobjectionable so far as it applies to the entities covered by the Act.\\nHowever, plaintiffs have failed to show either that the Act applies to manufacturers such as\\ndefendant, who do not install their products, or that homeowners would lack remedies\\nagainst manufacturers if the Act does not apply.   \\nIn short, in the absence of any allegations by plaintiffs that defendant ever installed\\nthe supposedly defective windows or otherwise acted as a contractor for any home\\nimprovement involving the windows at issue, I am not persuaded by plaintiffs’ arguments\\nthat a “person engaged in the business of making or selling home improvements” includes\\n7\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 8 of 8\\na product manufacturer that does not undertake the installation of the product. \\nAccordingly, I conclude that Wisconsin’s Home Improvement Practices Act is not applicable\\nto defendant.  \\nThis conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider whether plaintiffs Marie Lohr,\\nTerrance McIver or Jean Ann McIver have any viable claims under Chapter ATCP 110, as\\nalleged in claims VII- IX.\\nORDER\\nIT IS ORDERED that defendant Kolbe & Kolbe Millwork Co.’s motion to dismiss,\\ndkt. #43, is GRANTED with respect to the Home Improvement Practices Act claims alleged\\nin counts VII through IX of the amended complaint filed by plaintiffs Mary and Michael\\nHaley, Leslie and James Hal Banks, Annie and Brian Buinewicz, Terrance and Jean Ann\\nMcIver, Susan and Christian Senyk, Matthew and Renee Deller, Gary Samuels and Marie\\nLohr.  \\nEntered this 6th day of November, 2014.\\nBY THE COURT:\\n/s/\\nBARBARA B.

Plaintiffs assert\\nclaims for breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence and violations of Wis. Stat. §\\n100.18 of various provisions of the Wisconsin Administrative Code.  \\nDefendants have filed what they call a “motion to stay proceedings due to plaintiffs’\\nfailure to comply with Wis. Stat. § 895.07.”  Dkt. #46.  Under Wis. Stat. § 895.07(2), a\\nplaintiff who wishes to “commenc[e] an action against a contractor or supplier regarding a\\nconstruction defect” must give the defendant notice of the defect and an opportunity to cure\\nit.  The statute defines “supplier” to mean  “a person that manufactures or provides windows\\n1\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 59   Filed: 07/24/14   Page 2 of 6\\nor doors for a dwelling.”  Wis. Stat. § 895.07(1)(k).  If the plaintiff has not complied with\\nthe notice requirements in § 895.07, the court “shall stay the action and order the parties\\nto comply with the requirements.”  Wis. Stat.  § 895.07(3).  (If the defendant informed the\\nplaintiff of the notice of claim requirements before the parties entered into a contract, the\\ncourt must dismiss the case without prejudice to the plaintiff’s refiling it after complying\\nwith the requirements.  Id.  Because defendant does not allege that it informed plaintiff of\\nthe requirements, that aspect of the statute does not apply.)  \\nIn its motion, defendant argues that the named plaintiffs have not complied with §\\n895.07, so the case should be stayed until they do.  In response, plaintiffs say that the\\ndoctrine of laches bars defendant’s motion and that, even if the motion is not barred, the\\ncourt should deny it because all of the named plaintiffs gave defendant notice of their claims. \\nI am denying defendant’s motion because I agree with plaintiffs that it is untimely.\\nOPINION \\nBecause the parties do, I will assume for the purpose of defendant’s motion that\\ndefendant is a “person” under Wis. Stat. § 895.07(1)(k), that plaintiffs are alleging\\n“construction defects” under § 895.07(1)(e) and that, under Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304\\nU.S. 64 (1938), federal courts must stay cases brought under Wisconsin law when a plaintiff\\nfails to comply with the notice of claim requirements in § 895.07.  In addition, I need not\\ndecide the extent to which § 895.07 applies to class actions.  Instead, I conclude that\\ndefendants have forfeited any rights they have under § 895.07 by waiting too long to raise\\n2\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 59   Filed: 07/24/14   Page 3 of 6\\nthe issue.\\nIn arguing that defendant’s motion is untimely, plaintiffs rely on the Wisconsin\\ndoctrine of laches, under which “a party that delays making a claim may lose its right to\\nassert that claim.”  Zizzo v. Lakeside Steel & Manufacturing Co., 2008 WI App 69, 312\\nWis. 2d 463, 469-70, 752 N.W.2d 889, 892-93.  For the elements of a laches defense,\\nplaintiffs cite Ozaukee County. v. Flessas, 140 Wis. 2d 122, 127, 409 N.W.2d 408, 410 (Ct.\\nApp. 1987), in which the court stated that, “[f]or laches to arise, there must be unreasonable\\ndelay, knowledge [by the party asserting the right] of the course of events and acquiescence\\ntherein and prejudice to the party asserting the defense.”  In other cases, courts have\\ndescribed the second element not as whether the party asserting the right had knowledge,\\nbut whether the party asserting the laches defense did not know that the other party was\\ngoing to assert the right.  Sawyer v. Midelfort, 227 Wis. 2d 124, 159, 595 N.W.2d 423, 440\\n(1999).  However, defendant does not object to plaintiffs’ summary of the elements, so I do\\nnot consider that issue.  In addition, defendant does not object to plaintiffs’ argument that\\nthe doctrine applies to motions as well as claims, so I will assume that plaintiffs are correct\\nabout that issue as well.  Finally, I will assume as the parties do that it was defendant’s\\nburden to raise Wis. Stat. § 895.07 and that any failure by plaintiffs to comply with the\\nstatute can be waived or forfeited by defendant.\\nI will focus on the only issue debated by the parties, which is whether defendant’s\\ndelay in raising this issue was unreasonable.  In support of an argument that it was, plaintiffs\\nsay that they filed this lawsuit in February 2014 and that defendant did not raise Wis.

Ganz Dec. ¶¶ 3-4, dkt. #53. \\nIn response, defendant does not dispute plaintiffs’ description of what has happened\\nin this case so far and it does not deny that it would be unreasonable to wait five months to\\nseek a stay on claims that are subject to Wis. Stat. § 895.07 or that plaintiffs will be\\nprejudiced by a stay.  Instead, defendant’s argument against plaintiffs’ laches defense is that\\nthere was no unreasonable delay because defendant did not know that Wis. Stat. § 895.07\\napplied until plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on June 16, 2014. Dkt. #34.  In\\nparticular, defendants say that “[t]he plaintiffs’ original complaint included no Wisconsin\\nresidents as named plaintiffs, and the only claim it purported to assert under Wisconsin law\\nwas a cause of action for violation of Wis. Stat. sec. 100.18, which the plaintiffs quickly\\nagreed to dismiss as to all named plaintiffs except Gary Samuels.  Nothing in the original\\ncomplaint indicated that the plaintiffs purported to bring all of their claims under Wisconsin\\nlaw.”  Dft.’s Br., dkt. #57, at 2.\\nDefendant’s first argument that “[t]he plaintiffs' original complaint included no\\nWisconsin residents as named plaintiffs” is a nonstarter because defendant points to no\\nlanguage in Wis. Stat. § 895.07 that limits its application to Wisconsin residents.  In fact, \\nin its other brief, defendant argues that § 895.07 applies to all claims brought under\\nWisconsin law, regardless where a particular plaintiff might live.\\n4\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 59   Filed: 07/24/14   Page 5 of 6\\nDefendant’s second argument, that plaintiff’s original complaint included only one\\nWisconsin claim asserted by one plaintiff, is misleading because the argument suggests that\\nplaintiffs were asserting claims under a different state’s laws.  Wis. Stat. § 100.18 was the\\nonly Wisconsin statute plaintiffs cited, but they raised a number of common law claims as\\nwell, without specifying the state law that applied.  Because plaintiffs were suing a Wisconsin\\ncompany in a Wisconsin federal court and they stated that they wished to bring a lawsuit\\non behalf of a subclass of Wisconsin property owners, Cpt. ¶ 83, dkt. #1, it would have been\\nreasonable to assume that plaintiffs were relying on Wisconsin law for all of their claims. \\nIn fact, in arguing that its proposed stay should apply to all the claims in this case, defendant\\nrelies on the fact that plaintiffs are seeking to represent a subclass of Wisconsin residents. \\nDft.’s Br., dkt. #57, at 2.\\nIn any event, defendant’s second argument is self-defeating because defendant admits\\nthat plaintiff’s original complaint included a claim brought by at least one plaintiff under\\nWisconsin law.  Defendant does not suggest now that the claim under Wis. Stat. § 100.18\\nis exempt from the requirements of Wis. Stat. § 895.07 and it does not even attempt to\\nexplain why it failed to assert its rights under § 895.07 earlier as to that claim.  At this point,\\nafter the parties have engaged in substantial discovery, granting defendant’s motion would\\nserve no purpose but delay.   Accordingly, I conclude that defendant’s attempt to assert its\\nrights now is untimely.  This makes it unnecessary to consider plaintiffs’ alternative\\nargument that each of the named plaintiffs complied with the requirements of § 895.07.\\n5\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 59   Filed: 07/24/14   Page 6 of 6\\nIT IS ORDERED that defendant Kolbe & Kolbe Millwork Co., Inc.’s motion to stay\\nORDER\\nthe case, dkt. #46, is DENIED.\\nEntered this 24th day of July, 2014.\\nBY THE COURT:\\n/s/\\nBARBARA B.

Jones v. Lincoln Electric Co., 188 F.3d 709, 732 (7th Cir.1999).  A\\nmotion under Rule 60(b)(2) must be made “within a reasonable time” and “no more than\\na year after the entry of judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.”  Fed. R. Civ.

Although I entered an order dismissing plaintiffs’ § 100.18\\nclaim, defendant moved only for partial summary judgment and several of plaintiffs’ claims\\nare proceeding to trial.  Defendant does not address the applicability of Rule 60 or the\\nstandard of review.  In any event, the result is the same.  The “new” evidence does not save\\nthe claim brought by Groome and Samuels. \\nUnder Wis. Stat.§ 100.18(1), plaintiffs must demonstrate three elements: (1)\\ndefendant made a representation to the public with the intent to induce an obligation; (2)\\nthe representation was untrue, deceptive or misleading; and (3) the representation caused', 'plaintiffs a pecuniary loss.  K & S Tool & Die Corp. v. Perfection Machinery Sales, Inc.,\\n2007 WI 70, ¶ 19, 301 Wis. 2d 109, 732 N.W.2d 792.  In the summary judgment order,\\nI found that plaintiffs had failed to identify any specific factual representation that\\ndefendant had made with the intent to induce plaintiffs Groome and Samuels to purchase\\nits windows, as required under Wisconsin law.  United Concrete & Const., Inc. v.\\nRed-D-Mix Concrete, Inc., 2013 WI 72, ¶¶ 25 and 28, 349 Wis. 2d 587, 606-07, 836\\nN.W.2d 807, 816-17 (defendant must make representation about nature or quality of\\nproduct that is specific enough that its truth or falsity can be determined).  I decided that', 'defendant could not be held liable for vague statements by defendant’s distributor that\\ndefendant’s windows were “high quality” and “American made.”  Id. at ¶ 25 (seller not liable\\n3\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 384   Filed: 11/06/15   Page 4 of 6\\nfor “puffery” under § 100.18 because such exaggerations convey only an opinion and are not\\ncapable of being substantiated or refuted). \\nPlaintiffs now state that they have new evidence that defendant made false\\nrepresentations to the public, including evidence that defendant tested only certain windows\\n(“ringers”) to pass certification, misdirected class members regarding the “water preservation', \"capabilities” of its windows and installation instructions and artfully worded materials to\\nfalsely assure class members, builders and installers that its windows complied with building\\ncodes.  In support of their contentions, they cite the following evidence:\\n• Kenneth Wilcox, a research and development certification engineer for\\ndefendant, admitted in his deposition that “very few Kolbe windows that\\ncame off the line were used for certification testing” and that “R&D\\ncertification testing procedure had to be artfully worded so it doesn't\\nappear we only test ringers.”  Dkt. #289 at 153-58. \\n• Wilcox testified that design professionals and installers are not limited to\", 'following Kolbe’s installation instructions verbatim.  Id. at 169.  (Plaintiffs\\nstate without support that purchasers are required to follow these\\ninstructions.)\\n• George Digman, defendant’s director of research and development,\\ntestified that there are different standards for field testing and length of\\nservice after a window has been installed.  Dkt. #355 at 97.  \\n• Digman stated that defendant told customers that installers had to verify\\nthat the windows had been installed according to defendant’s instructions,\\nbut defendant had no official mechanism for installers to do this.  Id. at\\n126-28.                  \\n• Jerry Budnik, a service manager for defendant, stated in a 2007 internal', 'email to a research and development manager that defendant was receiving\\nan increasing number of complaints about rotting windows and that “we\\nreally need to start looking at our decaying problem.”  Dkt. #369, exh. 1. \\n4\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 384   Filed: 11/06/15   Page 5 of 6\\nContrary to plaintiffs’ contentions, this “new evidence” does not cure all of the\\ndeficiencies identified in the summary judgment order, and some of it does not seem to\\nrelate to any misrepresentation allegedly made by defendant.  Although plaintiffs submit\\ntestimony from two Kolbe employees who suggest that defendant may have acted in a', 'misleading manner, plaintiffs do not identify the particular misrepresentations that they\\nbelieve defendant made to any member of the public concerning the certification testing,\\n“water preservation capabilities” and building code compliance of its windows.  They have\\nadduced no evidence relating to when, where or how defendant made the misleading\\nstatements or representations.  Plaintiffs provide a bit more detail with respect to what\\ndefendant said or required concerning installation, but again, they fail to adduce any\\nevidence of the specific installation instructions given to the public.  They state only', 'generally that defendant includes instructions with each unit sold that must be followed to\\nfile a valid warranty claim.\\nFurther, plaintiffs still have not satisfied the third element of the § 100.18 claim\\nbecause they have not explained how defendant’s alleged misrepresentations and false\\nstatements caused pecuniary loss to plaintiffs Groome and Samuels.  K & S Tool & Die,\\n2007 WI 70 at ¶ 35 (causal connection required between untrue, deceptive or misleading\\nrepresentation and pecuniary loss).  Groome and Samuels did not identify any specific\\nstatements that they saw regarding certification, water preservation, building codes or', 'installation or link them to the loss they sustained.

In or around the summer of\\n2013, the 26 replacement windows began to discolor, rot and develop mold.  In or around\\nthe winter of 2013, the windows also developed significant condensation.\\n2\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 3 of 8\\nOPINION\\nPlaintiffs alleged in their complaint common law and statutory claims that defendant\\nbreached express and implied warranties, negligently misrepresented the condition of the', 'windows they sold, were negligent in the manufacture and design of the windows, made\\nfraudulent representations and have been unjustly enriched.  In addition, they alleged the\\nfour counts under Wisconsin’s Home Improvement Practices Act, Wis. Admin. Code §§\\nATCP 110.01-.09, that are at issue on defendant’s motion to dismiss.  \\nThe Home Improvement Practices Act applies to sellers of home improvements, as\\ndefined in § ATCP 110.01.   Under the Home Improvement Practices Act, a “seller” is\\ndefined as “a person engaged in the business of making or selling home improvements.”  The\\nterm “includes corporations, partnerships, associations, and any other form of business', 'organization or entity and their officers, representatives, agents, and employees.”  § ATCP\\n101.01(5).  “Home improvement” is defined in § ATCP 101.01(2) as:\\nthe remodeling, altering, repairing, painting, or modernizing of\\nresidential or non-commercial property, or the making of additions\\nthereto, and includes, but is not limited to, the construction,\\ninstallation, replacement, improvement, or repair of driveways,\\nsidewalks, swimming pools, terraces, patios, landscaping, fences,\\nporches, garages, basements and basement waterproofing, fire\\nprotection devices, heating and air conditioning equipment, water\\nsofteners, heaters and purifiers, wall-to-wall carpeting or attached or', 'inlaid floor coverings, and other changes, repairs, or improvements\\nmade in or on, attached to, or forming a part of, the residential or\\nnon-commercial property.  The term extends to the conversion of\\nexisting commercial structures into residential or non-commercial\\nproperty.  “Home improvement” does not include the construction of\\na new residence or the major renovation of an existing structure.\\nAccording to the legislative history of Chapter ATCP 110, Wisconsin has had\\n3\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 4 of 8\\nlegislation since at least 1953 directed at persons and companies engaging in misleading or', 'deceptive sales practices.  In the earliest examples, the regulation addressed persons using\\nmisleading practices when selling roofing and siding at retail, such as telling a prospective\\ncustomer that his house would serve as a “model home” for which he will be paid a\\ncommission or that he was being offered a special price.  Dkt. #44, Exh. B, Dept. of\\nAgriculture, In the Matter of the Codification of Rules, Dkt. No. 407, General Order 153,\\nSept. 3, 1953.  See also id., Exh. A at 3, “Findings of Department of Agriculture”:  “The evils\\nthat have developed [in the sale of roofing and siding] are due to unscrupulous salesmen', 'selling at retail and who make statements and representations which have the capacity to and\\ndo tend to mislead and deceive the prospective customer.”  Chapter ATCP 110 is the current\\nversion of the regulations, expanded to cover not just sellers of roofing and siding, but any\\nperson in the business of making or selling home improvements who engages in misleading\\nor deceptive sales practices. \\nThe question at issue is a purely legal one: does the Act apply to persons like\\ndefendant who sell windows but are not alleged to have installed them?   Defendant\\ncontends that it does not because the Home Improvement Practices Act was written to', 'regulate the entities constructing,  installing, repairing, remodeling and modernizing\\nresidential properties, not at the entities that provide the products used in those services.\\nDefendant notes that when the Act defines defining “home improvements,” it uses verbs\\nrather than nouns, talking in terms of work to be performed, such as altering, repairing,\\nmaking additions to residential or non-commercial property and installing and replacing\\n4\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 5 of 8\\nspecific items, along with “other changes, repairs or improvements made in or on, attached', 'to, or forming a part of, the residential or non-commercial property.”  It says nothing about\\nthe manufacturers or sellers of the products that a person making or selling home\\nimprovements may install or replace on the property as part of the remodeling process.  \\nDefendant points out that other provisions of the Act support its position that the\\nAct does not apply to manufacturers: (1) under § ATCP 110.04(1), sellers are required to\\nprovide all warranty documents to the buyer at the time the buyer enters into the home\\nimprovement contract, with the exception of manufacturers’ product warranties, which may\\nbe provided at the time of installation; (2) under § ATCP 110.05(2)(b), the home', 'improvement contract must describe the work to be done and the principal products and\\nmaterials to be used, which defendant says indicates that the rule targets the contractor, who\\nmust identify the work to be done and the products and materials to be used or installed,\\nwhereas a manufacturer such as defendant is not doing any work or installing anything; (3)\\nunder § ATCP 110.07(2)(c), a buyer whose payments have been used to purchase materials\\nfor the home improvement may require the  seller to deliver any undelivered materials to the\\nhome improvement site, which is a further indication that the manufacturers of products are', 'treated differently from contractors using the products.   Finally, it notes that no Wisconsin\\ncourt has held that a manufacturer is a “seller” under the Act.\\nPlaintiffs view the issue differently, arguing that the definition of “seller” extends to\\nentities that merely sell home improvements and that a window is clearly a “home\\nimprovement.”  They cite a number of cases, none of which provide support for their\\nposition.  Rohrer v. Willis, 2003 WI App 42, 260 Wis. 2d 602, 658 N.W.2d 88, an\\n5\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 6 of 8\\nunpublished decision, concerned a suit by homeowners against the members of the', 'corporation with which they had contracted for the installation of windows and which had\\nfailed to pay the manufacturer for the windows it installed.  The court of appeals noted that\\nthe manufacturer had placed a lien on the homeowners’ residence for the amount owed for\\nthe windows but the lien was essentially irrelevant to the question before it so the court had\\nno reason to identify the legal basis for it.  Plaintiffs concede that Wis. Stat. § 779.036(1)\\nwould have provided a legal basis for the lien and do not claim that it would have been\\nproper under Chapter ATCP 110.  In Complete Plumbing, Inc. v. Follett, 2012 WI App 73,', '342 Wis. 2d 251, 816 N.W.2d 352, another unpublished opinion, and Stuart v. Weisflog’s\\nShowroom Gallery, Inc., 2008 WI 22, 308 Wis. 2d 103, 746 N.W.2d 762, the courts never\\nhad occasion to address the question whether the Act would apply to a manufacturer of a\\nproduct not involved in the product’s installation because both suits were brought against\\ncontracting entities.  In Jackson v. DeWitt, 224 Wis. 2d 877, 592 N.W.2d 262 (Ct. App.\\n1999), the question was the construction of a contractor’s assignment of his interest in a\\nhome improvement contract; the only reference to the Act was the court of appeals’ holding', 'that under § ATCP 110.06, the assignee of a home improvement contract takes the contract\\nsubject to the claims and defenses of the consumer without regard to negotiability. \\nIn further support of their position that the Act applies to defendant, plaintiffs cite\\nanother unpublished Wisconsin Court of Appeals case, American Total Security, Inc. v.\\nGeneva Schultz Living Trust, 2007 WI App 1, 298 Wis. 2d 248, 726 N.W.2d 357, for the\\nproposition that “windows are a feature encompassed within the definition of ‘home\\nimprovement.’” Plts.’ Br., dkt. #58, at 4 n.1.

Stat. § 895.07(2), a', 'plaintiff who wishes to “commenc[e] an action against a contractor or supplier regarding a\\nconstruction defect” must give the defendant notice of the defect and an opportunity to cure\\nit.  The statute defines “supplier” to mean  “a person that manufactures or provides windows\\n1\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 59   Filed: 07/24/14   Page 2 of 6\\nor doors for a dwelling.”  Wis.

(If the defendant informed the', 'plaintiff of the notice of claim requirements before the parties entered into a contract, the\\ncourt must dismiss the case without prejudice to the plaintiff’s refiling it after complying\\nwith the requirements.  Id.  Because defendant does not allege that it informed plaintiff of\\nthe requirements, that aspect of the statute does not apply.)  \\nIn its motion, defendant argues that the named plaintiffs have not complied with §\\n895.07, so the case should be stayed until they do.

Tompkins, 304\\nU.S. 64 (1938), federal courts must stay cases brought under Wisconsin law when a plaintiff\\nfails to comply with the notice of claim requirements in § 895.07.  In addition, I need not', 'decide the extent to which § 895.07 applies to class actions.

Lakeside Steel & Manufacturing Co., 2008 WI App 69, 312\\nWis. 2d 463, 469-70, 752 N.W.2d 889, 892-93.  For the elements of a laches defense,\\nplaintiffs cite Ozaukee County. v. Flessas, 140 Wis. 2d 122, 127, 409 N.W.2d 408, 410 (Ct.', 'App. 1987), in which the court stated that, “[f]or laches to arise, there must be unreasonable\\ndelay, knowledge [by the party asserting the right] of the course of events and acquiescence\\ntherein and prejudice to the party asserting the defense.”  In other cases, courts have\\ndescribed the second element not as whether the party asserting the right had knowledge,\\nbut whether the party asserting the laches defense did not know that the other party was\\ngoing to assert the right.  Sawyer v. Midelfort, 227 Wis. 2d 124, 159, 595 N.W.2d 423, 440\\n(1999).  However, defendant does not object to plaintiffs’ summary of the elements, so I do', 'not consider that issue.  In addition, defendant does not object to plaintiffs’ argument that\\nthe doctrine applies to motions as well as claims, so I will assume that plaintiffs are correct\\nabout that issue as well.  Finally, I will assume as the parties do that it was defendant’s\\nburden to raise Wis. Stat. § 895.07 and that any failure by plaintiffs to comply with the\\nstatute can be waived or forfeited by defendant.\\nI will focus on the only issue debated by the parties, which is whether defendant’s\\ndelay in raising this issue was unreasonable.

Instead, defendant’s argument against plaintiffs’ laches defense is that\\nthere was no unreasonable delay because defendant did not know that Wis.

In\\nparticular, defendants say that “[t]he plaintiffs’ original complaint included no Wisconsin\\nresidents as named plaintiffs, and the only claim it purported to assert under Wisconsin law\\nwas a cause of action for violation of Wis.

Nothing in the original', \"complaint indicated that the plaintiffs purported to bring all of their claims under Wisconsin\\nlaw.”  Dft.’s Br., dkt. #57, at 2.\\nDefendant’s first argument that “[t]he plaintiffs' original complaint included no\\nWisconsin residents as named plaintiffs” is a nonstarter because defendant points to no\\nlanguage in Wis.

In fact, \\nin its other brief, defendant argues that § 895.07 applies to all claims brought under\\nWisconsin law, regardless where a particular plaintiff might live.\\n4\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 59   Filed: 07/24/14   Page 5 of 6\", 'Defendant’s second argument, that plaintiff’s original complaint included only one\\nWisconsin claim asserted by one plaintiff, is misleading because the argument suggests that\\nplaintiffs were asserting claims under a different state’s laws.  Wis. Stat. § 100.18 was the\\nonly Wisconsin statute plaintiffs cited, but they raised a number of common law claims as\\nwell, without specifying the state law that applied.  Because plaintiffs were suing a Wisconsin\\ncompany in a Wisconsin federal court and they stated that they wished to bring a lawsuit\\non behalf of a subclass of Wisconsin property owners, Cpt. ¶ 83, dkt. #1, it would have been', 'reasonable to assume that plaintiffs were relying on Wisconsin law for all of their claims. \\nIn fact, in arguing that its proposed stay should apply to all the claims in this case, defendant\\nrelies on the fact that plaintiffs are seeking to represent a subclass of Wisconsin residents. \\nDft.’s Br., dkt. #57, at 2.\\nIn any event, defendant’s second argument is self-defeating because defendant admits\\nthat plaintiff’s original complaint included a claim brought by at least one plaintiff under\\nWisconsin law.  Defendant does not suggest now that the claim under Wis. Stat. § 100.18\\nis exempt from the requirements of Wis.

At this point,\\nafter the parties have engaged in substantial discovery, granting defendant’s motion would\\nserve no purpose but delay.   Accordingly, I conclude that defendant’s attempt to assert its\\nrights now is untimely.

Although plaintiffs submit\\ntestimony from two Kolbe employees who suggest that defendant may have acted in a\\nmisleading manner, plaintiffs do not identify the particular misrepresentations that they\\nbelieve defendant made to any member of the public concerning the certification testing,\\n“water preservation capabilities” and building code compliance of its windows.  They have\\nadduced no evidence relating to when, where or how defendant made the misleading\\nstatements or representations.  Plaintiffs provide a bit more detail with respect to what\\ndefendant said or required concerning installation, but again, they fail to adduce any\\nevidence of the specific installation instructions given to the public.  They state only\\ngenerally that defendant includes instructions with each unit sold that must be followed to\\nfile a valid warranty claim.\\nFurther, plaintiffs still have not satisfied the third element of the § 100.18 claim\\nbecause they have not explained how defendant’s alleged misrepresentations and false\\nstatements caused pecuniary loss to plaintiffs Groome and Samuels.

It manufactured the defective\\nwindows at issue in this case.\\nPlaintiff Marie Lohr is a resident of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, who had approximately\\n30 Kolbe aluminum-cladded windows installed when her home was built in 2001.  Within\\nmonths of installation, the windows developed condensation and the wood on all of the\\nwindows began to rot and deteriorate.  In late 2010, defendant inspected and replaced 26\\nof the windows with new, aluminum-cladded Kolbe windows.  In or around the summer of\\n2013, the 26 replacement windows began to discolor, rot and develop mold.  In or around\\nthe winter of 2013, the windows also developed significant condensation.\\n2\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 3 of 8\\nOPINION\\nPlaintiffs alleged in their complaint common law and statutory claims that defendant\\nbreached express and implied warranties, negligently misrepresented the condition of the\\nwindows they sold, were negligent in the manufacture and design of the windows, made\\nfraudulent representations and have been unjustly enriched.  In addition, they alleged the\\nfour counts under Wisconsin’s Home Improvement Practices Act, Wis. Admin. Code §§\\nATCP 110.01-.09, that are at issue on defendant’s motion to dismiss.  \\nThe Home Improvement Practices Act applies to sellers of home improvements, as\\ndefined in § ATCP 110.01.   Under the Home Improvement Practices Act, a “seller” is\\ndefined as “a person engaged in the business of making or selling home improvements.”  The\\nterm “includes corporations, partnerships, associations, and any other form of business\\norganization or entity and their officers, representatives, agents, and employees.”  § ATCP\\n101.01(5).  “Home improvement” is defined in § ATCP 101.01(2) as:\\nthe remodeling, altering, repairing, painting, or modernizing of\\nresidential or non-commercial property, or the making of additions\\nthereto, and includes, but is not limited to, the construction,\\ninstallation, replacement, improvement, or repair of driveways,\\nsidewalks, swimming pools, terraces, patios, landscaping, fences,\\nporches, garages, basements and basement waterproofing, fire\\nprotection devices, heating and air conditioning equipment, water\\nsofteners, heaters and purifiers, wall-to-wall carpeting or attached or\\ninlaid floor coverings, and other changes, repairs, or improvements\\nmade in or on, attached to, or forming a part of, the residential or\\nnon-commercial property.  The term extends to the conversion of\\nexisting commercial structures into residential or non-commercial\\nproperty.  “Home improvement” does not include the construction of\\na new residence or the major renovation of an existing structure.\\nAccording to the legislative history of Chapter ATCP 110, Wisconsin has had\\n3\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 4 of 8\\nlegislation since at least 1953 directed at persons and companies engaging in misleading or\\ndeceptive sales practices.  In the earliest examples, the regulation addressed persons using\\nmisleading practices when selling roofing and siding at retail, such as telling a prospective\\ncustomer that his house would serve as a “model home” for which he will be paid a\\ncommission or that he was being offered a special price.  Dkt. #44, Exh. B, Dept. of\\nAgriculture, In the Matter of the Codification of Rules, Dkt. No. 407, General Order 153,\\nSept. 3, 1953.  See also id., Exh. A at 3, “Findings of Department of Agriculture”:  “The evils\\nthat have developed [in the sale of roofing and siding] are due to unscrupulous salesmen\\nselling at retail and who make statements and representations which have the capacity to and\\ndo tend to mislead and deceive the prospective customer.”  Chapter ATCP 110 is the current\\nversion of the regulations, expanded to cover not just sellers of roofing and siding, but any\\nperson in the business of making or selling home improvements who engages in misleading\\nor deceptive sales practices. \\nThe question at issue is a purely legal one: does the Act apply to persons like\\ndefendant who sell windows but are not alleged to have installed them?   Defendant\\ncontends that it does not because the Home Improvement Practices Act was written to\\nregulate the entities constructing,  installing, repairing, remodeling and modernizing\\nresidential properties, not at the entities that provide the products used in those services.\\nDefendant notes that when the Act defines defining “home improvements,” it uses verbs\\nrather than nouns, talking in terms of work to be performed, such as altering, repairing,\\nmaking additions to residential or non-commercial property and installing and replacing\\n4\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 5 of 8\\nspecific items, along with “other changes, repairs or improvements made in or on, attached\\nto, or forming a part of, the residential or non-commercial property.”  It says nothing about\\nthe manufacturers or sellers of the products that a person making or selling home\\nimprovements may install or replace on the property as part of the remodeling process.  \\nDefendant points out that other provisions of the Act support its position that the\\nAct does not apply to manufacturers: (1) under § ATCP 110.04(1), sellers are required to\\nprovide all warranty documents to the buyer at the time the buyer enters into the home\\nimprovement contract, with the exception of manufacturers’ product warranties, which may\\nbe provided at the time of installation; (2) under § ATCP 110.05(2)(b), the home\\nimprovement contract must describe the work to be done and the principal products and\\nmaterials to be used, which defendant says indicates that the rule targets the contractor, who\\nmust identify the work to be done and the products and materials to be used or installed,\\nwhereas a manufacturer such as defendant is not doing any work or installing anything; (3)\\nunder § ATCP 110.07(2)(c), a buyer whose payments have been used to purchase materials\\nfor the home improvement may require the  seller to deliver any undelivered materials to the\\nhome improvement site, which is a further indication that the manufacturers of products are\\ntreated differently from contractors using the products.   Finally, it notes that no Wisconsin\\ncourt has held that a manufacturer is a “seller” under the Act.\\nPlaintiffs view the issue differently, arguing that the definition of “seller” extends to\\nentities that merely sell home improvements and that a window is clearly a “home\\nimprovement.”  They cite a number of cases, none of which provide support for their\\nposition.  Rohrer v. Willis, 2003 WI App 42, 260 Wis. 2d 602, 658 N.W.2d 88, an\\n5\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 6 of 8\\nunpublished decision, concerned a suit by homeowners against the members of the\\ncorporation with which they had contracted for the installation of windows and which had\\nfailed to pay the manufacturer for the windows it installed.  The court of appeals noted that\\nthe manufacturer had placed a lien on the homeowners’ residence for the amount owed for\\nthe windows but the lien was essentially irrelevant to the question before it so the court had\\nno reason to identify the legal basis for it.  Plaintiffs concede that Wis. Stat. § 779.036(1)\\nwould have provided a legal basis for the lien and do not claim that it would have been\\nproper under Chapter ATCP 110.  In Complete Plumbing, Inc. v. Follett, 2012 WI App 73,\\n342 Wis. 2d 251, 816 N.W.2d 352, another unpublished opinion, and Stuart v. Weisflog’s\\nShowroom Gallery, Inc., 2008 WI 22, 308 Wis. 2d 103, 746 N.W.2d 762, the courts never\\nhad occasion to address the question whether the Act would apply to a manufacturer of a\\nproduct not involved in the product’s installation because both suits were brought against\\ncontracting entities.  In Jackson v. DeWitt, 224 Wis. 2d 877, 592 N.W.2d 262 (Ct. App.\\n1999), the question was the construction of a contractor’s assignment of his interest in a\\nhome improvement contract; the only reference to the Act was the court of appeals’ holding\\nthat under § ATCP 110.06, the assignee of a home improvement contract takes the contract\\nsubject to the claims and defenses of the consumer without regard to negotiability. \\nIn further support of their position that the Act applies to defendant, plaintiffs cite\\nanother unpublished Wisconsin Court of Appeals case, American Total Security, Inc. v.\\nGeneva Schultz Living Trust, 2007 WI App 1, 298 Wis. 2d 248, 726 N.W.2d 357, for the\\nproposition that “windows are a feature encompassed within the definition of ‘home\\nimprovement.’” Plts.’ Br., dkt. #58, at 4 n.1.  Although the court of appeals found that\\n6\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 7 of 8\\nAmerican Total Security’s contract with defendant for the purchase and installation of\\nwindows violated § ATCP 110.05(2) (“Home improvement contract requirements”),  id. at\\n¶¶ 3, 8, it never said that “windows are encompassed within the definition of ‘home\\nimprovement.’”  In fact, it never explained the grounds for its finding that American Total\\nSecurity was a covered “seller”; instead, it merely adopted the finding it had made when the\\ncase was before it at an earlier stage.  (No copy of that earlier decision is available.) \\nPresumably, at that time, it explained why it found that American Total Security was\\ncovered under § ATCP 110.01(5).  That would be a proper conclusion in a situation in\\nwhich the defendant had contracted with American Total Security for both the windows and\\ntheir installation.  Whether the state court would have reached the same result if the case\\nhad not involved installation of the windows is impossible to determine.  \\nPlaintiffs argue that an Act such as Chapter ATCP 110 should be construed broadly\\nto effectuate its purposes of protecting homeowners from unscrupulous manufacturers as\\nwell as sellers using deceptive practices to defraud persons seeking home improvements. \\nThat argument is unobjectionable so far as it applies to the entities covered by the Act.\\nHowever, plaintiffs have failed to show either that the Act applies to manufacturers such as\\ndefendant, who do not install their products, or that homeowners would lack remedies\\nagainst manufacturers if the Act does not apply.   \\nIn short, in the absence of any allegations by plaintiffs that defendant ever installed\\nthe supposedly defective windows or otherwise acted as a contractor for any home\\nimprovement involving the windows at issue, I am not persuaded by plaintiffs’ arguments\\nthat a “person engaged in the business of making or selling home improvements” includes\\n7\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 87   Filed: 11/06/14   Page 8 of 8\\na product manufacturer that does not undertake the installation of the product. \\nAccordingly, I conclude that Wisconsin’s Home Improvement Practices Act is not applicable\\nto defendant.  \\nThis conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider whether plaintiffs Marie Lohr,\\nTerrance McIver or Jean Ann McIver have any viable claims under Chapter ATCP 110, as\\nalleged in claims VII- IX.\\nORDER\\nIT IS ORDERED that defendant Kolbe & Kolbe Millwork Co.’s motion to dismiss,\\ndkt. #43, is GRANTED with respect to the Home Improvement Practices Act claims alleged\\nin counts VII through IX of the amended complaint filed by plaintiffs Mary and Michael\\nHaley, Leslie and James Hal Banks, Annie and Brian Buinewicz, Terrance and Jean Ann\\nMcIver, Susan and Christian Senyk, Matthew and Renee Deller, Gary Samuels and Marie\\nLohr.  \\nEntered this 6th day of November, 2014.\\nBY THE COURT:\\n/s/\\nBARBARA B.

Plaintiffs assert\\nclaims for breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence and violations of Wis. Stat. §\\n100.18 of various provisions of the Wisconsin Administrative Code.  \\nDefendants have filed what they call a “motion to stay proceedings due to plaintiffs’\\nfailure to comply with Wis. Stat. § 895.07.”  Dkt. #46.  Under Wis. Stat. § 895.07(2), a\\nplaintiff who wishes to “commenc[e] an action against a contractor or supplier regarding a\\nconstruction defect” must give the defendant notice of the defect and an opportunity to cure\\nit.  The statute defines “supplier” to mean  “a person that manufactures or provides windows\\n1\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 59   Filed: 07/24/14   Page 2 of 6\\nor doors for a dwelling.”  Wis. Stat. § 895.07(1)(k).  If the plaintiff has not complied with\\nthe notice requirements in § 895.07, the court “shall stay the action and order the parties\\nto comply with the requirements.”  Wis. Stat.  § 895.07(3).  (If the defendant informed the\\nplaintiff of the notice of claim requirements before the parties entered into a contract, the\\ncourt must dismiss the case without prejudice to the plaintiff’s refiling it after complying\\nwith the requirements.  Id.  Because defendant does not allege that it informed plaintiff of\\nthe requirements, that aspect of the statute does not apply.)  \\nIn its motion, defendant argues that the named plaintiffs have not complied with §\\n895.07, so the case should be stayed until they do.  In response, plaintiffs say that the\\ndoctrine of laches bars defendant’s motion and that, even if the motion is not barred, the\\ncourt should deny it because all of the named plaintiffs gave defendant notice of their claims. \\nI am denying defendant’s motion because I agree with plaintiffs that it is untimely.\\nOPINION \\nBecause the parties do, I will assume for the purpose of defendant’s motion that\\ndefendant is a “person” under Wis. Stat. § 895.07(1)(k), that plaintiffs are alleging\\n“construction defects” under § 895.07(1)(e) and that, under Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304\\nU.S. 64 (1938), federal courts must stay cases brought under Wisconsin law when a plaintiff\\nfails to comply with the notice of claim requirements in § 895.07.  In addition, I need not\\ndecide the extent to which § 895.07 applies to class actions.  Instead, I conclude that\\ndefendants have forfeited any rights they have under § 895.07 by waiting too long to raise\\n2\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 59   Filed: 07/24/14   Page 3 of 6\\nthe issue.\\nIn arguing that defendant’s motion is untimely, plaintiffs rely on the Wisconsin\\ndoctrine of laches, under which “a party that delays making a claim may lose its right to\\nassert that claim.”  Zizzo v. Lakeside Steel & Manufacturing Co., 2008 WI App 69, 312\\nWis. 2d 463, 469-70, 752 N.W.2d 889, 892-93.  For the elements of a laches defense,\\nplaintiffs cite Ozaukee County. v. Flessas, 140 Wis. 2d 122, 127, 409 N.W.2d 408, 410 (Ct.\\nApp. 1987), in which the court stated that, “[f]or laches to arise, there must be unreasonable\\ndelay, knowledge [by the party asserting the right] of the course of events and acquiescence\\ntherein and prejudice to the party asserting the defense.”  In other cases, courts have\\ndescribed the second element not as whether the party asserting the right had knowledge,\\nbut whether the party asserting the laches defense did not know that the other party was\\ngoing to assert the right.  Sawyer v. Midelfort, 227 Wis. 2d 124, 159, 595 N.W.2d 423, 440\\n(1999).  However, defendant does not object to plaintiffs’ summary of the elements, so I do\\nnot consider that issue.  In addition, defendant does not object to plaintiffs’ argument that\\nthe doctrine applies to motions as well as claims, so I will assume that plaintiffs are correct\\nabout that issue as well.  Finally, I will assume as the parties do that it was defendant’s\\nburden to raise Wis. Stat. § 895.07 and that any failure by plaintiffs to comply with the\\nstatute can be waived or forfeited by defendant.\\nI will focus on the only issue debated by the parties, which is whether defendant’s\\ndelay in raising this issue was unreasonable.

Ganz Dec. ¶¶ 3-4, dkt. #53. \\nIn response, defendant does not dispute plaintiffs’ description of what has happened\\nin this case so far and it does not deny that it would be unreasonable to wait five months to\\nseek a stay on claims that are subject to Wis. Stat. § 895.07 or that plaintiffs will be\\nprejudiced by a stay.  Instead, defendant’s argument against plaintiffs’ laches defense is that\\nthere was no unreasonable delay because defendant did not know that Wis. Stat. § 895.07\\napplied until plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on June 16, 2014. Dkt. #34.  In\\nparticular, defendants say that “[t]he plaintiffs’ original complaint included no Wisconsin\\nresidents as named plaintiffs, and the only claim it purported to assert under Wisconsin law\\nwas a cause of action for violation of Wis. Stat. sec. 100.18, which the plaintiffs quickly\\nagreed to dismiss as to all named plaintiffs except Gary Samuels.  Nothing in the original\\ncomplaint indicated that the plaintiffs purported to bring all of their claims under Wisconsin\\nlaw.”  Dft.’s Br., dkt. #57, at 2.\\nDefendant’s first argument that “[t]he plaintiffs' original complaint included no\\nWisconsin residents as named plaintiffs” is a nonstarter because defendant points to no\\nlanguage in Wis. Stat. § 895.07 that limits its application to Wisconsin residents.  In fact, \\nin its other brief, defendant argues that § 895.07 applies to all claims brought under\\nWisconsin law, regardless where a particular plaintiff might live.\\n4\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 59   Filed: 07/24/14   Page 5 of 6\\nDefendant’s second argument, that plaintiff’s original complaint included only one\\nWisconsin claim asserted by one plaintiff, is misleading because the argument suggests that\\nplaintiffs were asserting claims under a different state’s laws.  Wis. Stat. § 100.18 was the\\nonly Wisconsin statute plaintiffs cited, but they raised a number of common law claims as\\nwell, without specifying the state law that applied.  Because plaintiffs were suing a Wisconsin\\ncompany in a Wisconsin federal court and they stated that they wished to bring a lawsuit\\non behalf of a subclass of Wisconsin property owners, Cpt. ¶ 83, dkt. #1, it would have been\\nreasonable to assume that plaintiffs were relying on Wisconsin law for all of their claims. \\nIn fact, in arguing that its proposed stay should apply to all the claims in this case, defendant\\nrelies on the fact that plaintiffs are seeking to represent a subclass of Wisconsin residents. \\nDft.’s Br., dkt. #57, at 2.\\nIn any event, defendant’s second argument is self-defeating because defendant admits\\nthat plaintiff’s original complaint included a claim brought by at least one plaintiff under\\nWisconsin law.  Defendant does not suggest now that the claim under Wis. Stat. § 100.18\\nis exempt from the requirements of Wis. Stat. § 895.07 and it does not even attempt to\\nexplain why it failed to assert its rights under § 895.07 earlier as to that claim.  At this point,\\nafter the parties have engaged in substantial discovery, granting defendant’s motion would\\nserve no purpose but delay.   Accordingly, I conclude that defendant’s attempt to assert its\\nrights now is untimely.  This makes it unnecessary to consider plaintiffs’ alternative\\nargument that each of the named plaintiffs complied with the requirements of § 895.07.\\n5\\n\\x0c\\nCase: 3:14-cv-00099-bbc   Document #: 59   Filed: 07/24/14   Page 6 of 6\\nIT IS ORDERED that defendant Kolbe & Kolbe Millwork Co., Inc.’s motion to stay\\nORDER\\nthe case, dkt. #46, is DENIED.\\nEntered this 24th day of July, 2014.\\nBY THE COURT:\\n/s/\\nBARBARA B.

(Doc. 480).  For the following reasons, \\nRespondent’s Objections to and Motion for Reconsideration of the Magistrate’s \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 2 of 9                                             \\n      \\nOrder (Doc. 479) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  It is granted to the \\nextent that the Court herein reconsiders portions of Magistrate Judge Gorman’s \\nOrder, however all of its objections are DENIED.  Magistrate Judge Gorman’s \\nOrder is AFFIRMED, and Petitioner’s Lien is to be paid in full. \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\nThe underlying litigation in this matter began in 2004, when Respondent \\nTrish Lee McCloud filed suit against Goodyear Dunlop Tires for injuries she \\nsustained in a motorcycle accident.  (Doc. 1).  Respondent’s claim was tried to a jury, \\nand the jury rendered a verdict in her favor, awarding her damages in the amount \\nof $15,000,000.14.  (Doc. 378 at 2).  Of this total award, $472,794.14 was for the \\n“reasonable value of necessary medical care, treatment, services and life care needs \\nof [Respondent] to the present time.”  (Doc. 378 at 1).  The verdict was appealed \\n(Doc. 422) and the parties reached a settlement, which was approved by this Court \\non December 10, 2008 (Doc. 436).   \\n \\nFollowing the settlement of the case, Petitioner, OSF Healthcare System \\nd/b/a Saint Francis Medical Center (“OSF”), filed a Petition to Adjudicate a Lien \\npursuant to the Health Care Services Lien Act, 770 ILCS 23/1 et. seq., seeking to \\nrecover the $261,902.33 that it had billed to Respondent for medical goods and \\nservices provided to her after her motorcycle accident.  (Doc. 445). After ordering \\nfuller briefing addressing the merits of the Petition (Doc. 448), as well as the Court’s \\njurisdiction over it (Text Order of 12/18/09), the Court determined that it had  \\nancillary jurisdiction over the Petition pursuant to the settlement agreement, and \\n \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 3 of 9                                             \\n      \\nreferred the matter to Magistrate Judge Gorman for further post-judgment \\nproceedings related thereto.  (Doc. 454 at 3-4).   \\n \\nSubsequently, Magistrate Judge Gorman presided over all matters relating \\nto the Petition to Adjudicate Liens, including allowing the withdrawal of \\nPetitioner’s Motion for Sanctions (Text Order of 3/4/2010), denying a Motion to \\nCompel Discovery filed by Respondent (Doc. 469), and ordering that Petitioner’s lien \\nbe paid in full (Doc. 478).  It is this final order, which adjudicated Petitioner’s lien \\nand determined that it should be paid in full, to which Respondent now objects.  \\n(Doc. 479).  Respondent argues that Magistrate Judge Gorman did not have \\njurisdiction to enter such an order, and that the order is erroneous and contrary to \\nlaw.   \\nI. Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Jurisdiction \\n \\nSection 636 of Title 28 of the United States Code sets forth the jurisdiction of \\na United States Magistrate Judge.  According to that statute, a magistrate judge \\nhas jurisdiction to hear and determine various pretrial matters of a non-dispositive \\nnature upon designation by the district judge.  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A).  Further, \\nupon the consent of the parties, a magistrate judge may conduct any or all \\nproceedings in a nonjury civil matter and order entry of judgment in the case, when \\nspecially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court.  § 636(c)(1).  \\nConsent under § 636(c)(1) may be either express or inferred from the parties’ \\nconduct during litigation.  Roell v. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580 (2003).  Where a litigant \\nis “made aware of the need for consent and the right to refuse it, and still \\nvoluntarily appear[s] to try the case before the Magistrate Judge” consent is \\n \\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 4 of 9                                             \\n      \\nproperly inferred, and the Magistrate Judge has jurisdiction.  Id. at 590.  Finally, “a \\nmagistrate judge may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent \\nwith the Constitution and laws of the United States.” § 636(b)(3).  \\n   \\nRespondent argues that Magistrate Judge Gorman did not have jurisdiction \\nto enter judgment on the Petition to Adjudicate Liens under § 636(c).  Specifically, \\nRespondent states that there was never any indication that the Petition was \\nreferred to Magistrate Judge Gorman for the purposes of entering judgment, and \\nthat therefore Respondent did not consent to his doing so.  (Doc. 479 at 2-3).  \\nTherefore, Respondent argues that the Court should treat Magistrate Judge \\nGorman’s order as a proposed finding and recommendation pursuant to § \\n636(b)(1)(B), and engage in a de novo review of the portions of his order to which \\nRespondent now objects.  (Doc. 479 at 3).   \\n \\nPetitioner responds that Magistrate Judge Gorman did, in fact, have \\njurisdiction over their Petition to Adjudicate Liens pursuant to § 636(c)(1), and that \\ntherefore his order must be treated as the final judgment of this Court.  (Doc. 480 at \\n2).  According to Petitioner, the parties impliedly consented to Magistrate Judge \\nGorman’s jurisdiction pursuant to § 636(c)(1) due to the fact that they voluntarily \\nproceeded before him on numerous occasions after this Court referred the matter to \\nhim in its Order and Opinion of January 14, 2010.  (Doc. 480 at 2-3).  Because \\nRespondent never objected to Magistrate Gorman’s jurisdiction prior to his final \\norder adjudicating the lien, Petitioner maintains that the parties consented to his \\njurisdiction, and cannot now complain simply because his final decision was adverse \\nto them.  (Doc. 480 at 2). \\n \\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 5 of 9                                             \\n      \\n \\nThe Court is confused over this dispute as Magistrate Judge Gorman never \\nentered any judgment, but instead issued an Order on Petitioner’s Petition to \\nAdjudicate Liens, as was referred to him by this Court.  This is undoubtedly not a \\ncase to which the parties consented pursuant to §636(c)(1), as the parties were \\nnever made aware of the need to formally consent to the Magistrate Judge’s \\njurisdiction; nor did they ever expressly do so.  Instead, because the power to \\nadjudicate liens is not expressly granted in either the federal statute or this Court’s \\nLocal Rules, the Court finds that the case was properly referred to Magistrate \\nJudge Gorman pursuant to § 636(b)(3), the catch-all provision of the Federal \\nMagistrates Act, which allows for the referral of any matter which is not \\ninconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.    \\n \\nBecause the adjudication of Petitioner’s lien was dispositive of Petitioner’s \\nclaim, it is appropriate to adopt the standard of review for dispositive pretrial \\nmatters: a de novo review upon the record.  Talbott v. Empress River Casino, 1997 \\nWL 458537, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 4, 1997).  “A de novo review does not require a new \\nhearing, but the Court must give fresh consideration to those issues to which \\nspecific objections have been made.”  Id. (internal quotations omitted).  Accordingly, \\nthe Court will take a fresh look at the portions of Judge Gorman’s Order to which \\nRespondent has now objected.     \\nII. Objections to Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Order \\n \\nThe first objection Respondent makes to Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Order of \\nJuly 13, 2010 (Doc. 478) is that he found that the Illinois “common fund doctrine” \\ndid not apply to hospital liens.  In making this determination, Magistrate Judge \\n \\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 6 of 9                                             \\n      \\nGorman disregarded an Illinois Court of Appeals for the Fifth District decision, \\nHowell v. Dunaway, 924 N.E.2d 1190 (Ill. App. 2010), which diverged from previous \\nIllinois law and held that the doctrine did, in fact, apply to hospital liens such as \\nthose asserted by Petitioner.  However, since the time Respondent filed her \\nobjections, the Illinois Supreme Court has issued an opinion reversing the Fifth \\nDistrict’s opinion, and explicitly holding that, in Illinois, the common fund doctrine \\nis not applicable to health care liens under the Health Care Services Lien Act.  \\nWendling v. Southern Ill. Hosp. Svcs., ---N.E.2d ---, 2011 WL 1085186 (Ill. March 24, \\n2011).  Accordingly, Magistrate Judge Gorman’s prediction of Illinois law was fully \\ncorrect and Respondent’s first objection to his Order of July 13, 2010 (Doc. 478) \\nfails.1    \\n \\nIn addition, Respondent argues that she raised three other claims before \\nMagistrate Judge Gorman, which he rejected without articulating his reasons for \\ndoing so.  These claims include:  1) Petitioner’s claim should be reduced because its \\ncharges for Ms. McCloud’s treatment were substantially higher than Petitioner \\nwould have received for the same services provided to an insured patient, or if it \\nhad timely sought reimbursement for all of its charges from Michigan Medicaid, \\nbecause otherwise Petitioner would be unjustly enriched to the detriment of \\nRespondent; 2) Petitioner’s lien claim should be denied because Petitioner has not \\n                                                           \\n1Respondent concedes that her objection to Magistrate Judge Gorman’s \\ndetermination regarding applicability of the common fund doctrine to health care \\nliens would fail if the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the Fifth District’s decision in \\nHowell. (Doc. 479 at 6).  Specifically, Respondent invited the Court to “defer final \\nadjudication of the lien pending a decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in the \\nHowell case, at which point, any uncertainty regarding the state of Illinois law on \\nthis subject will be resolved.”  (Doc. 479 at 6).   \\n \\n6\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 7 of 9                                             \\n      \\nsatisfied its burden that the amount of the lien is reasonable and because \\nRespondent was denied an opportunity to make discovery on that issue; and 3) \\nPetitioner’s acceptance of Medicaid reimbursement for a portion of its charges bars \\nits current claim for reimbursement from Respondent.  (Doc. 479 at 4-5).  Although \\nRespondent makes no arguments in support of these claims in its current \\nObjections, because the Court is performing a de novo review on the record, it will \\nlook to the parties’ briefs before Magistrate Judge Gorman in order to determine \\nwhether Respondent’s claims are with or without merit.   \\nA. Reduction of Claim to Amount That Would Be Paid by Insurance \\nRespondent’s first argument is that Petitioner’s Lien should have been \\nreduced to the amount that Petitioner would have received in reimbursement had \\nthey billed the services to either public or private insurance.  (Doc. 472 at 8).  Ms. \\nMcCloud did not have private insurance, however she may have been eligible for \\nMedicaid coverage, and there is evidence that Petitioner filed a claim with Michigan \\nMedicaid to recover payment. (Doc. 472 Exh. A).  There is also evidence that had \\nMedicaid allowed Petitioner’s claim, which it instead denied as being untimely filed, \\nit would have paid in the amount of $130,951.17.  (Doc. 472 Exh. A).  Therefore, \\nRespondent argues that Petitioner would now be unjustly enriched if it is allowed to \\nrecover more than the $130,951.17 it would have received had it timely filed its \\nclaim with Michigan Medicaid.   \\nSeveral federal cases have discussed whether or not a hospital should be \\nallowed to assert a lien against a patient’s recovery from a third party tortfeasor \\nwhen that hospital has already recovered a portion of its bills from Medicaid.  All of \\n \\n7\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 8 of 9                                             \\n      \\nthese cases have held that when a hospital bills and accepts payment from \\nMedicaid, its claim must be treated as paid in full, and it may no longer seek to \\nrecover any fees from the patient or any other party.  See Evanston Hosp. v. Hauck, \\n1 F.3d 540 (7th Cir. 1993); Miller v. Gorski Wladyslaw Estate, 547 F.3d 273 (5th Cir. \\n2008).  Conversely, these cases indicate that when the hospital has not accepted \\npayment from Medicaid, it is free to seek full recovery from the patient.  See id.  \\nHere, because Michigan Medicaid denied its claim, Petitioner never actually \\naccepted payment from Michigan Medicaid, thus leaving all of Petitioner’s bills \\nunpaid.  Respondent argues that, nevertheless, Petitioner should be barred from \\nrecovering a greater amount now as it would be in essence receiving a windfall for \\nits failure to timely file its claim with Michigan Medicaid.  While this may be the \\ncase, because Petitioner never actually accepted payment from Michigan Medicaid, \\nprecedent dictates that it is free to seek full recovery from Respondent or any other \\nthird party source.  Accordingly, Respondent’s second objection also fails.     \\nB. Whether The Amount of the Lien is Reasonable and Necessary \\nNext, Respondent argues that Petitioner’s Lien should be denied because \\nPetitioner did not satisfy its burden of showing that its charges were reasonable or \\ncustomary.  (Doc. 472 at 11).  However, as Magistrate Judge Gorman found in his \\nOrder denying Respondent’s Motion to Compel Discovery (Doc. 469) on this issue, \\nthe bills upon which Petitioner now seeks to recover were presented to the jury as \\npart of Respondent’s damages at trial.  Moreover, the jury there found that \\nRespondent’s medical bills were reasonable.  (Doc. 378 at 1).  Respondent may not \\nrely upon Petitioner’s medical bills as part of its case before the jury, but now, when \\n \\n8\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 9 of 9                                             \\n      \\nPetitioner seeks to recover upon them, dispute that they were not reasonable or \\nnecessary.   Therefore, this objection also fails.   \\nC. Prior Acceptance of Payment \\nFinally, Respondent argues that Petitioner should be barred from recovering \\non its lien because “it is apparent that one of the bills for services rendered to Ms. \\nMcCloud was submitted by [P]etitioner to Michigan Medicaid for reimbursement in \\ntimely fashion and the claim was paid.”  (Doc. 472 at 15).  However, as Petitioner \\npointed out in its Response to Respondent’s Brief (Doc. 475), the payment to which \\nRespondent points was not made to Petitioner, but to a separate doctor, Doctor \\nBenito Camacho.  (See Doc. 472 Exh. B). Accordingly, Respondent’s claim for \\nreduction is utterly without merit, and its final objection is also denied.   \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\nFor the foregoing reasons, Respondent’s Objections to and Motion for \\nReconsideration of the Magistrate’s Order (Doc. 479) is GRANTED in part and \\nDENIED in part.  It is granted to the extent that the Court has here reconsidered \\nportions of Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Order, however all of its objections are \\nDENIED.  The Order of Magistrate Judge Gorman is AFFIRMED, Petitioner’s \\nPetition to Adjudicate Liens (Doc. 445) is GRANTED, and its Lien of $261,902.33 is \\nto be paid in full.

That motorcycle accident is the subject of this\\nlitigation. The billed amount for those goods and services was $261,902.33. When this lawsuit was\\nfiled, OSF served a lien against the injury claim for that amount. \\nTrish McCloud’s claim was tried to a jury, which rendered a Verdict in her favor, awarding\\ndamages in the amount of $15,000,000.14. That Verdict was itemized; the amount awarded for\\npayment of past medical care, treatment, services and life care needs was $472,794.14. (See Verdict,\\nDoc. #378). That amount, which included the OSF bills, was presented by the Plaintiff as part of\\nstipulated medical expenses, the reasonableness of which was undisputed at trial.\\nThe Verdict was appealed, and on appeal the parties participated in the Seventh Circuit’s\\nsettlement process. The case was settled for a confidential amount. The settlement was approved by\\nthe Court on December 10, 2008. The approval included attorney’s fees of 40% of the settlement\\namount plus expenses, which totaled $551,811.73.\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 2 of 6                                             \\n      \\nAfter the settlement fund was established and paid, Plaintiff’s lawyers and OSF lawyers began\\nnegotiations over satisfaction of the lien. They have been unsuccessful in resolving their differences.\\nOSF maintains that it is entitled to the entire amount of its lien, while Plaintiff contends that the\\nsettlement amount is subject to the common fund doctrine1 and should accordingly be reduced by 40%\\nfor attorney fees and by pro-rata litigation expenses.\\n OSF seeks adjudication of its lien pursuant to the Healthcare Services Lien Act2, 770 ILCS\\n23/30, which provides in pertinent part:\\n§ 30. Adjudication of rights. On petition filed by the injured person or the health care\\nprofessional or health care provider and on the petitioner's written notice to all interested\\nadverse parties, the circuit court shall adjudicate the rights of all interested parties and enforce\\ntheir liens. \\nUnder this Act, so long as the total amount of liens is less than 40% of the verdict or\\nsettlement, the lien is enforceable. 770 ILCS 23/10(c). There is no dispute between Plaintiff and OSF\\nthat the amount of liens is less than 40% of the settlement. What is not clear, however, is whether the\\nlien is subject to the common fund doctrine. \\nThe question whether the common fund doctrine applies to liens of medical providers was\\nmentioned in Baier v. State Farm Ins. Co., 361 N.E.2d 1100 (Ill.1977). In that case, the plaintiff was\\nan attorney who had represented a plaintiff in an automobile accident case. His client’s insurer had\\npaid his client $1000, which was the policy limit for medical bills. To obtain that amount, his client\\n1In an Order entered earlier in this case (See Order, Doc. #469), a motion to compel was\\ndenied. In that Order, the Court found specifically that Plaintiff would not be allowed to challenge\\nthe jury’s finding that Plaintiff’s medical bills, including those from OSF, were reasonable and\\ncustomary, either directly or indirectly. Plaintiff’s indirect challenges were based on what an\\ninsured patient would have paid and what Medicaid would have paid. In the briefing regarding\\nadjudication of the OSF lien, these issues were again raised; they are again rejected. \\n2This case is in federal court on diversity jurisdiction, so Illinois law governing liens\\napplies to this dispute. \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 3 of 6                                             \\n      \\nhad signed a document reflecting that the payment was a “loan” to be repaid only “in the event and\\nto the extent that any net recovery is made” from a tortfeasor. The document also required the insured\\nto sue if there was a basis for doing so. Suit was filed and the insurer notified the other driver’s insurer\\nthat it claimed $1000 subrogation rights from any proceeds in the case.\\nThe attorney obtained a settlement of $12,000. The other driver’s insurer paid in 2 drafts: one\\nfor $11,000 payable to the attorney and his client and one for $1000 payable to the insurer for $1000.\\nIn the course of deciding whether the common fund doctrine applied to the subrogor/subrogee\\nrelationship (the Supreme Court held that it did), the Baier Court noted that the insurer had\\nhypothesized that if the doctrine applied to the subrogor/ subrogee relationship, then it might also\\napply to a medical provider who had rendered medical services. Because the case before it did not\\npresent that question, the Court declined to consider it. 361 N.E.2d at 1102. In reaching its decision,\\nthe Baier Court commented that the common fund doctrine is based on the “equitable concept that an\\nattorney who performs services in creating a fund should in equity and good conscience be allowed\\ncompensation out of the whole fund from all those who seek to benefit from it.” 361 N.E.2d at 1102.\\nShortly after Baier was decided, the issue of whether the common fund doctrine applies to\\nhospital liens presented itself squarely. In Maynard v. Parker, 387 N.E.2d 298 (Ill.1979), the plaintiff\\nsued for injuries sustained in a car accident. His damages included $11,027.96 for his hospital bill.\\nUnder the then-extant hospital liens act, the hospital noticed its lien. The case settled for $37,500.\\nDefendant’s insurer issued a draft for $11,027.96 to the Plaintiff, his wife, his attorney and the\\nhospital. The hospital then filed its petition to adjudicate the rights of the parties to that amount. The\\ntrial court ordered that the hospital pay from the total amount one-third of the costs incurred ($205.48)\\nand one-third of the total for attorney’s fees. The hospital appealed, and the appellate court reversed.\\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 4 of 6                                             \\n      \\nBefore the Supreme Court, the plaintiff argued that the trial court had properly applied the\\ncommon fund doctrine. The Supreme Court rejected that argument, finding two “important\\ndistinctions” between the case before it and Baier. First, the types of relationships between the parties\\nin Baier differed significantly: “Here, the plaintiff’s liability to the hospital was not dependent upon\\nthe creation of a fund; plaintiff was a debtor obligated to pay for the services rendered by the hospital\\nout of any resources which might become available to him.” Id. at 300. Unlike Baier, where the\\nsubrogor and subrogee stood in the same shoes, the Plaintiff and the hospital had entirely separate\\nlegal interests and obligations. Second, there was no limitation on the amount of the lien that could\\nbe claimed in Baier, whereas the amount of the lien in Maynard could not, pursuant to the Lien Act,\\n“exceed one-third of the sum paid or due to said injured person...” Id, quoting Ill. Rev. Stat.1975, ch.\\n82 ¶ 97. Because of these two distinctions, the Court concluded that the common fund doctrine was\\nnot applicable to hospital liens.\\nThe common fund doctrine again reached the State Supreme Court in Bishop v. Burgard, 764\\nN.E.2d 24 (Ill.2002). In that case, an employee sued the driver of the other vehicle involved in a car\\naccident that had injured the employee. She signed a contingency agreement with her attorney. The\\nemployee’s medical bills, totaling $8,576.30, had been paid by the employer’s medical plan, which\\nhad noticed its lien in that amount against the proceeds of the lawsuit. The case settled for $21,500.\\nPlaintiff’s attorney was unsuccessful in efforts to have the Plan reduce its lien by one-third to reflect\\nattorney’s fees, so he filed a petition to adjudicate the lien. The issues presented included whether\\nERISA preempted the doctrine in this context and, if not, whether the doctrine applied or whether the\\nterms of the plan prevailed. In addition, if the terms of the plan prevailed, there remained the question\\nwhether the terms of the plan were unenforceable as a violation of public policy. \\nThe Bishop Court relied on Ragan v. Columbia Mutual Ins. Co., 701 N.E.2d 493 (1998), which\\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 5 of 6                                             \\n      \\nhad held that ERISA does not preempt the common fund doctrine. Finding nothing in the case before\\nit that would call Scholtens into question either substantively or on the facts, the Court applied\\nScholtens. The Court emphasized that ERISA does not preempt the doctrine because the claim for\\nattorney’s fees arises independently of both the benefit plan and the subrogation agreement. Bishop,\\n764 N.E.2d at 31. See Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Svc. Inc., 486 U.S. 825, 833 n.8\\n(1988)(noting in dicta that common fund claims for attorney’s fees are not preempted by ERISA).\\nFurthermore, because of its independent nature, a common fund claim for attorney’s fees is not\\ngoverned by the terms of the plan. Bishop, 764 N.E.2d at 34.\\nA few months ago, the Illinois Court of Appeals for the Fifth District decided Howell v.\\nDunaway, 924 N.E.2d 1190 (Ill.App.2010). The Howell Court found that, in Bishop, the Supreme\\nCourt had expanded the common fund doctrine from its expression in Maynard, shifting the focus from\\nthe relationship between the parties to the “real question” of “whether the claimant had benefitted from\\nthe lawsuit without contributing to its costs, thereby becoming unjustly enriched.” Id. at 1195. The\\nHowell Court pointed out that the relationship between a plaintiff and a hospital/lienholder is much\\nmore like a subrogor/subrogee relationship “than the court in Maynard recognized.” Id.. \\nWith all due respect to the Howell Court, the Supreme Court of Illinois has spoken, clearly and\\nunambiguously: the common fund doctrine does not apply to hospital liens. Moreover, I do not believe\\nthat the Supreme Court will adopt the reasoning used by the Fifth Circuit in Howell.  The “shift in\\nfocus” noted by the Howell Court is not nearly as pervasive as that Court would have it.  In Bishop,\\nthe Supreme Court emphasized the centrality of the nature of the relationship between the parties,\\nemphasizing that  the quasi-contractual right to payment of fees was independent of and irrelevant to\\nthe contractual relationship between the health care plan and the beneficiary.   764 N.E.2d at 31. It was\\nonly in the context of those  relationships that the Court reached its decision that ERISA did not\\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 6 of 6                                             \\n      \\npreempt the common fund doctrine as it applies to attorney’s fees claims. Bishop demonstrates with\\nsome force that the nature of the relationship between the parties remains crucial in deciding whether\\nthe common fund doctrine applies.  There is nothing in that opinion to suggest that a reconsideration\\nof Maynard is forthcoming.  \\n Other than the Howell challenge to the lien, Plaintiff has raised no other significant issue. I\\nconclude that Maynard applies, and under Maynard, the lien asserted by OSF is not subject to the\\ncommon fund doctrine.\\nThe OSF lien is therefore to be paid in full. The Petition by OSF is allowed. \\nENTERED ON July 13, 2010 \\ns/ John A. Gorman \\nJOHN A.

(Doc. 445).  Petitioner states that it holds a hospital lien \\npursuant to the Illinois Health Care Services Lien Act, 770 ILCS 23/1 et seq., \\nagainst a jury verdict and judgment obtained by Trish Lee McCloud in this Court.  \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 448    Page 2 of 3                                             \\n      \\nMs. McCloud1 admits that her attorney did receive notice of the lien, but denies that \\nshe recovered the amount of the jury verdict.  Moreover, Ms. McCloud states that \\nPetitioner would be unjustly enriched if it collects the claimed amount of the lien \\nfrom her, because Petitioner already accepted Medicaid payment and a tax write-off \\nof the claimed expenses.  (Doc. 447).   \\n \\nOn August 24, 2007, a jury verdict in the amount of $15,000,000.14 was \\nentered in this case in favor of Ms. McCloud.  (Doc. 378).  A judgment for this \\namount followed on August 30, 2007.  (Doc. 382).  However, Defendant Goodyear \\nDunlop Tires North America filed a Notice of Appeal on June 24, 2008.  (Doc. 422).  \\nDuring the appeal, the parties negotiated a settlement, and they moved the Court to \\napprove the settlement and requested the Court of Appeals to remand the case for \\nthat purpose.  (Doc. 432).  The Court subsequently vacated the August 30, 2007 \\njudgment, approved the terms of the confidential settlement2 after a fairness \\nhearing, and dismissed the case with prejudice.  (Doc. 436).                  \\n \\n \\nIn its Petition to Adjudicate Liens, Petitioner relies on the August 24, 2007 \\njury verdict.  As Ms. McCloud asserts, she did not recover payment on the jury \\nverdict, as the judgment arising from it was vacated.  Therefore, no lien can exist \\nagainst the jury verdict or the judgment arising from it.  In re Estate of Cooper, 532 \\nN.E.2d 236, 238-39 (Ill. 1988) (“Only when a recovery is made can the lien come into \\nexistence, because absent a provision to the contrary, a lien is created only when \\n                                                           \\n1  \\nThe Petition to Adjudicate Liens names Ms. McCloud, Conybeare Law Office, \\nand Randy James & Associates as Respondents.

At the \\nfinal pretrial conference this Court ordered expedited briefing \\non this issue and Granted Defendants leave to file a Reply \\nBrief.  Defendants filed their Reply Brief [Doc. 229] on July 2, \\n2007.  For the following reasons, this Court holds that Illinois \\nLaw governs this case and Defendants Motion [Doc. 217] is \\nDENIED. \\n   \\n \\n  \\nI. \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\nThis case arises out of a motorcycle accident that occurred \\n \\non Interstate 55 in Livingston County, Illinois.  Plaintiff, \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 2 of 16                                            \\n       \\nTrish McCloud was riding on the back of a motorcycle driven by \\nPlaintiff, William Booker.1  Together they were returning to \\nBaldwin, Michigan from a “blessing of the bikes” event in East \\nSaint Louis, Illinois.  (Doc. 224 at 8.)  \\n \\nThe motorcycle they were riding on was a 1985 Honda \\nGoldwing with tires that were manufactured by Goodyear Dunlop \\nTires of North America, Ltd. (“Dunlop”).  While traveling \\nNorthbound on Interstate 55, the rear tire of the motorcycle \\n“suddenly and catastrophically deflated.”  (Doc. 218 at 1.)  As \\na result of the accident, McCloud was permanently and severely \\ndisabled.   \\nPlaintiff alleges that the accident was caused by a \\ndefectively manufactured rear tire.  Defendants, on the other \\nhand, argue that the reason for the blowout was that the tire \\nhad been run overloaded and underinflated for a long period of \\ntime.  \\nOn June 13, 2007, Defendants filed the Motion currently \\nbefore the Court in which they allege that Michigan law should \\napply to the facts of this case.  Plaintiff, in Response, argues \\nthat Illinois law should apply.  To that end, there are several \\nadditional facts which are integral to the matter at bar.  \\n                                                           \\n1 Since the briefs were filed related to this Order, Plaintiff \\nWilliam Booker has dismissed his claims against Defendants and \\nno longer is a party to this case.  \\n \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 3 of 16                                            \\n       \\nDefendants emphasize the following; Booker purchased the \\ntire and that it was installed at a store in Michigan; At the \\ntime of the accident, both Booker and McCloud were residents of \\nMichigan (Doc. 218 at 4-5.); And, according to Defendants, “the \\nevidence shows that Booker used the motorcycle with the subject \\ntire for two years, primarily in Michigan....” (Doc. 218 at 2.)  \\nHowever, Defendants do not provide any evidence which would \\nsupport their assertion that the motorcycle was primarily used \\nin Michigan.  \\nPlaintiff, on the other hand, reiterates that the accident \\noccurred in Illinois and that she and Booker were traveling back \\nfrom East Saint Louis, Illinois.  In addition, McCloud states \\nthat St. Francis Medical Center, an Illinois non-profit \\ncorporation, has a lien for $261,902.32 against any recovery she \\nmight have in this action.  (Doc. 224 at 8.)  And finally, \\nPlaintiff points to evidence that shows that the subject tire \\nwas primarily used in Illinois.  Specifically, Plaintiff points \\nto Booker’s deposition testimony in which Booker discusses the \\nadditional trips that he made on the subject tire.  From there, \\nMcCloud puts together several computations from which she \\nconcludes that 32 percent of the miles accumulated on the \\nsubject tire were accumulated in Illinois, 26 percent were in \\nMichigan, 19 percent were in Indiana, 8 percent were in Ohio, 6 \\npercent were in Kentucky, 5 percent were in Tennessee, and 4 \\n \\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 4 of 16                                            \\n       \\npercent were in Alabama.  Defendants do not raise any facts \\nchallenging this computational analysis in their Reply Brief \\n(Doc. 229).  As a result, this Court concludes that more miles \\nwere placed on the subject tire in Illinois than in any other \\nstate. \\nII. \\nANALYSIS \\n \\nFederal courts apply the choice of law rules of the state \\nwhere the matter was originally filed.  Klaxon Co. v. Stentor \\nElectric Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941).  The case at bar was \\nfiled in the Central District of Illinois, so Illinois’ choice \\nof law rules apply.   \\nIllinois follows the “most significant relationship” \\napproach.  Ingersoll v. Klein, 262 N.E.2d 593, 596 (Ill. 1970).  \\nThis approach is laid out in the Restatement (Second) of \\nConflict of Law § 145.  Under this approach there is a \\npresumption that the law of the state where the injury occurred \\nshould govern.  Ingersoll, 262 N.E.2d at 595.  That presumption \\ncan be overcome if there is another state that has a more \\nsignificant relationship to the occurrence or the parties.  To \\ndetermine which state has a more significant relationship, our \\nAppellate Court has paraphrased the two relevant sets of \\ncriteria as follows: \\n“The first set of criteria includes general \\nfactors such as the needs of the interstate system; \\n \\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 5 of 16                                            \\n       \\nrelevant policies of the forum and other interested \\nstates; protection of justified expectations; the \\nbasic policies underlying the particular field of law; \\ncertainty, predictability and uniformity of result; \\nand ease in the determination and application of the \\nlaw to be applied. The second set of criteria includes \\nthe contacts to be taken into account in applying \\nthese principles. These contacts are: (1) the place of \\nthe injury; (2) the place of misconduct; (3) the \\ndomicile, residence, nationality, place of \\nincorporation and place of business of the parties; \\nand (4) the place where the relationship between the \\nparties is centered.” \\nIn re Air Crash Disaster Near Chicago, Illinois on May \\n25, 1979, 644 F.2d 594, 611-12 (7th Cir. 1981). \\n \\nFurthermore, our appellate court has ruled that the choice \\nof law determination for each relevant issue is severable.  \\nSpecifically, “[t]he application of choice-or-law rules is not a \\nmechanical process of cranking various factors through a \\nformula.  Critical to conflicts analysis is the notion that \\n[courts] must examine the choice-of-law rules not with regard to \\nvarious states’ interests in general, but precisely, with regard \\nto each state’s interest in the specific question [at bar].”  \\nId.  As a result, courts are to embrace the doctrine of depecage \\nin which a court separately considers which state’s law governs \\neach substantive issue.  If there are multiple issues which \\nwould be resolved differently under the law of two potentially \\ninterested jurisdictions, then a court must analyze these issues \\nseparately.  \\n  \\n \\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 6 of 16                                            \\n       \\nIn the case at bar, both sides agree that Illinois and \\nMichigan law have substantive differences regarding certain \\nissues relevant to this case. Illinois applies strict liability \\nto certain claims for manufacturing defects, See Blue v. \\nEnvironmental Engineering, Inc., 828 N.E.2d 1128 (2005), while \\nMichigan bases claims for manufacturing defects in negligence.  \\nPrentis v. Yale Mfg. Co., 421 Mich. 670 (Mich. 1984).  Illinois \\nrecognizes comparative negligence and bars recovery where the \\nplaintiff’s negligence is greater than fifty percent, 735 ILCS \\n5/2-1116, while Michigan has a system of pure comparative \\nnegligence so a plaintiff’s recovery is diminished by the \\npercentage of the plaintiff’s fault.  M.C.L. § 600.2959.  And, \\nMichigan has capped non-economic damages in product liability \\nactions at $500,000 in cases such as this.  M.C.L § 600.2946a.  \\n \\nThere is no dispute that there are certain facts in the \\ncase at bar which weigh heavily in favor of applying Illinois \\nlaw.  First, the accident occurred in Illinois.  As already \\nnoted, this alone creates a presumption that Illinois law \\napplies.  Secondly, under the Defendant’s theory of liability, \\nthe accident occurred because the subject tire was overloaded \\nand underinflated.  Since the tire was used in Illinois more \\n \\n6\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 7 of 16                                            \\n       \\nthan any other state, under the Defendant’s theory of liability, \\nthe injury causing conduct occurred primarily in Illinois.2  \\nFinally, on the trip in question, Plaintiff was returning \\nfrom her destination in Illinois.  This is relevant because \\nDefendants repeatedly argue that the injury “fortuitously” \\noccurred in Illinois because Plaintiff was simply passing \\nthrough the state. (Doc. 218 at 8, citing Schulze v. Illinois \\nHighway Transportation Co., 423 N.E.2d 278 (3rd Dist. 1981)).  In \\nparticular, Defendants repeatedly attempt to equate this case to \\nan airplane accident in which a plane fortuitously crashes in a \\nparticular state without any other connections to the situs of \\nthe crash.  (Doc. 218, citing In re Air Crash Disaster Near \\nRoselawn, Indiana on October 31, 1994, 926 F.Supp. 736, 742-43 \\n(N.D.Ill. 1996)(“Roselawn III”).  However, the facts do not \\nmirror the parallel that Defendants wish to draw.  At the time \\nof the accident, Plaintiff had specifically traveled to a \\nlocation in Illinois (the “blessing of the bikes” in East Saint \\nLouis, Illinois), and was on her return journey from East Saint \\nLouis, Illinois when the accident occurred.  It was not a random \\noccurrence that the accident happened in Illinois because the \\nmajority of miles over the life of the bike were from roads \\n                                                           \\n2 Under the Plaintiff’s theory of liability the injury causing \\nconduct was the faulty manufacturing of the tire in New York.  \\nSince no party is arguing for application of New York law, this \\nfact does not weigh in either party’s favor and is not relevant \\nto the analysis for choosing between Illinois and Michigan law.  \\n \\n7\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 8 of 16                                            \\n       \\ntraveled in Illinois.  Furthermore, the majority of the trip in \\nquestion was spent in Illinois and the destination of the trip \\nwas Illinois.  As a result, the fact that the accident occurred \\nin Illinois was not “fortuitous” but was instead a byproduct of \\nthe Plaintiff’s chosen journeys to and through Illinois.3  \\n \\nTogether, these facts create a strong presumption that \\nIllinois law should apply.  As a result, under the doctrine of \\ndepacage Defendant has the burden of pointing to the specific \\nareas of law where Michigan law should govern, and must put \\nforward strong policy considerations for applying Michigan law.  \\nIn the case at bar, Defendants put forward policy consideration \\nin the areas of 1) liability and 2) damages.4  For the following \\n                                                           \\n3 Defendants seem to semantically argue in favor of the word \\n“fortuitous” and state that “regardless of the fact that 32% of \\nthe tires total mileage accrued in Illinois, there was still a \\ngreater chance that the failure could have happened in the other \\nstates where the remaining 68% usage occurred.”  Defendants are \\ncorrect in that any time a random accident occurs in interstate \\ntravel its location is technically “fortuitous.”  However, in \\nthe case at bar, more miles were placed on the tire in Illinois \\nthan any other state.  And, Plaintiff was specifically on a trip \\nto Illinois.  As a result, based on the evidence before the \\nCourt, the accident and resulting injuries were more likely to \\noccur in Illinois than any other state.  \\n  Defendants state that they wish for Michigan’s comparative \\nfault law to apply.  However, Defendants do not put forward any \\npolicy analysis in their initial brief (Doc. 218) which would \\nassist this Court in concluding that Michigan law should apply \\nto this issue.   \\n 4\\n \\n8\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 9 of 16                                            \\n       \\nreasons Defendants’ policy considerations do not overcome the \\npresumption that Illinois law applies.5  \\n1. Liability \\nDefendants argue that the relationship between the parties \\nwas formed in Michigan.  Specifically, William Booker purchased \\nthe motorcycle tires in Michigan.  And, Trish McCloud chose to \\nbegin the journey in question on Booker’s motorcycle in \\nMichigan.  By getting on the motorcycle in Michigan she formed \\nher trust in the motorcycle and its wheels in Michigan.  \\nDefendants argue that because the relationship was formed \\nin Michigan, and because Plaintiff was a resident of Michigan at \\nthe time of the accident, policy concerns favor application of \\nMichigan liability law.   \\nIllinois has adopted the concept of strict liability in \\nproducts liability cases.  Garrison v. Heublein, Inc., 673 F.2d \\n189 (7th Cir. 1982).  In a product liability case, to recover \\nunder strict liability, a Plaintiff must show that an injury \\nresulted from a condition of the product, the condition must be \\nunreasonably dangerous, and the condition must have existed at \\n                                                           \\n5 Plaintiff’s primary argument in response is that Defendants’ \\nhave not filed a timely request for an application of Michigan \\nlaw.   The Defendant’s choice of law determination is not \\nsubject to the Court’s dispositive motion deadline.  \\nFurthermore, Plaintiff does not point to any local rule or other \\nauthority which requires that a choice of law motion be filed by \\na specific time.  Accordingly, the Court will not dispose of \\nDefendants’ request as untimely.  \\n \\n \\n9\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 10 of 16                                           \\n        \\nthe time the product left the manufacturer's control.  30A Ill. \\nLaw and Prac. Products Liability § 3.  \\nMichigan, on the other hand applies negligence law to \\nproducts liability claims.  In re Disaster at Detroit \\nMetropolitan Airport on August 16, 1987, 750 F.Supp. 793, 801 \\n(E.D.Mich. 1989).  According to Defendants, Michigan has adopted \\nthis policy to ensure that the public would not be “deprived of \\na product” absent a showing of fault.  Specifically, the \\nnegligence standard “incorporates greater intrinsic fairness in \\nthat the careful safety oriented manufacturer will not bear the \\nburden of paying for losses caused by the negligent product \\nseller....”  Prentis, 421 Mich. at 690.   \\nHowever, in the case at bar, Defendants have not argue that \\na “negligent product seller” caused the tire’s alleged defects.  \\n(Defendants Amended Answer – Doc. 36.)  Instead, they have \\nrepeatedly argued that the tire ruptured because Booker \\noverloaded and underinflated the subject tire.  Defendants can \\nstill make this argument because under Illinois law Plaintiff \\nmust show that the tire in question was defective ‘at the time \\nit left Defendants’ control.’  If Booker overloaded and \\nunderinflated the tire and this caused the tires’ relevant \\ndefects, then the defects did not exist when the tire left \\nDefendants’ control.  In such a case, Plaintiff would be lacking \\nan essential element to recover under Illinois’ strict liability \\n \\n10\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 11 of 16                                           \\n        \\nlaw.  As a result, the policy considerations regarding a \\nnegligent product seller put forward by Defendants (Doc. 218 at \\n12) do not apply in this case and certainly do not overcome the \\npresumption that Illinois law governs. \\n2. Damages \\nThe laws regarding damages in Illinois and Michigan are \\nvastly different.  Michigan law caps non-economic damages at \\n$500,000 in cases such as this. Michigan Comp. Laws § 600.2946a \\n(2003).  Michigan also allows damages to be reduced because of \\ncollateral source payments.  Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.6303(a).  \\nAnd, Michigan requires a court to reduce both future economic \\nand non-economic damages to their present cash value.  Mich. \\nComp. Laws § 600.6306.  Illinois, on the other hand, does not \\nhave a cap on damages, does not allow for evidence of collateral \\nsource payments, and only requires a court to reduce future \\neconomic damages.  \\nDefendants repeatedly emphasize that Plaintiff was an \\nIllinois resident at the time of the accident, and that the tire \\nwas sold in Michigan.  Accordingly, Defendants argue that \\nMichigan law should apply to the issue of damages. Defendants \\ncite Roselawn III, 926 F.Supp. at 746, which states that  \\n“[t]he choice of law of the plaintiff’s domicile \\nis the most sensible solution to conflicts concerning \\ncompensatory damages.  The reason is that the \\nplaintiff’s state has the most significant interest in \\nthe compensation of its domiciliaries.  It is \\n \\n11\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 12 of 16                                           \\n        \\ninconceivable that a plaintiff’s state’s limits upon \\ncompensation can be said to constitute a desire to \\ngive its residents less than complete compensation.”6   \\n In response, Plaintiff focuses on the statutory cap on \\ndamages and points to a recent state appellate opinion.  \\nTownsend ex rel. Townsend v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 858 N.E.2d \\n552 (Ill. App. 1st 2006).  In Townsend, an Illinois Appellate \\nCourt ruled that a forum state has a compelling policy interest \\nin protecting against legislative encroachment into the \\njudiciaries’ right to determine damages.  The Illinois Supreme \\nCourt has previously ruled that a cap on damages violates the \\nseparation of powers clause in Illinois’ Constitution because it \\ninfringed on the judiciary’s right to determine damages.  See \\nBest v. Taylor Machine Works, 689 N.E.2d 1057, 1081 (Ill. 1997).  \\nAccording to Townsend, there is a compelling state interest in \\nprotecting the rights of the judiciary, and this interest \\n                                                           \\n6 This Court disagrees with the reasoning of the Roselawn III \\nCourt.  When placing caps on product liability damages a state \\nlegislature balances the interest of completely compensating \\ntheir injured residents against the risk that they could be over \\ncompensated by overly sympathetic juries that lack appropriate \\nbenchmarks for determining damages.  A resident of a state with \\nan overtly strict limit on damages could legitimately disagree \\nwith his own legislature and, if impassioned enough, choose to \\nvacation outside of his state and into a forum which placed a \\ngreater emphasis on product safety.  Or, a severely and \\npermanently injured resident of the overtly strict forum could \\nbelieve that his legislature has barred him from being complete \\ncompensation.  This is not to say that Michigan’s laws are \\nstrict.  Instead, it is simply to point out that it is quite \\n‘conceivable’ that a plaintiff could persuasively argue that his \\nown state’s limits on damages have left him less than \\n‘completely compensated.’  \\n  \\n \\n12\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 13 of 16                                           \\n        \\noverrides any interest that the foreign state might have in \\ncapping non-economic damages.  Id. at 912-914.  As a result, a \\ncourt is required to consider that interest when making a choice \\nof law determination.  And, all other things being equal, \\nIllinois interest in keeping decisions on damages in the hands \\nof the judiciary overrides any interest that Michigan may have \\nin applying their cap.  \\n \\nAs long as Townsend is valid law in Illinois,7 Illinois law \\ngoverning caps on damages applies to this case.  Furthermore, \\nunder the facts before the Court, even without Townsend, \\nIllinois law still governs the issue of damages. \\n \\nDefendants argue correctly that Michigan has an interest in \\nchoosing how well its residents are compensated for their \\ninjuries from defective products.  However, Illinois also has an \\ninterest in any damage award that Plaintiff may receive because \\nIllinois has an interest in making sure that tourists visiting \\n                                                           \\n7 Defendants point out that the Illinois Supreme Court has \\nrecently agreed to hear the appeal of Townsend.  Townsend v. \\nSears, Roebuck and Co., 865 N.E.2d 978 (table) (Ill. 2007).  \\nHowever, unless and until the Illinois Supreme Court issues an \\nopinion reversing the decision of the Illinois Appellate Court, \\nthe current Townsend opinion provides the best available \\nguidance on how the Illinois Supreme Court would rule on this \\nissue.  See Adams v. Fred Weber, Inc., 849 F.2d 1018, 1026 (7th \\nCir. 1988); McGeshick v. Choucair, 9 F.3d 1229, 1232 (7th Cir. \\n1993)(noting that a federal court can only diverge from a \\ndecision of a state appellate court if a party has presented \\n“good reason” for diverging from the appellate court’s \\ndecision).  \\n \\n13\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 14 of 16                                           \\n        \\nIllinois are adequately compensated for injuries that occur in \\nIllinois. \\nHere, it is important to emphasize that Plaintiff was not \\nsimply passing through Illinois, but was visiting Illinois.  \\nIllinois’ laws related to damages certainly do not favor the \\nproducers of products wishing to limit their liability.  \\nInstead, Illinois’ product liability laws allow for \\nmanufacturers to face higher damages and are thus further \\ndiscouraged from producing dangerous products.  For example, \\nIllinois law allows for greater liability because it does not \\nprovide a cap on damages, it does not allow for evidence of \\ncollateral source payments, and it only requires a court to \\nreduce future economic damages.  See Supra.  \\nIllinois has an interest in not only protecting its \\ncitizens but also its visitors from faulty products – even if \\nthat means providing greater damages (and greater protection) \\nthan a visitor might receive in his home state.  See Vlasic v. \\nWyndham, 451 F.Supp.2d 1005 (C.D.Ill. 2006)(ruling that Aruba \\nlaw applied to a tourist injured in Aruba and noting that Aruba \\nhas an interest in providing a safe environment for tourists).  \\nAnd, that policy interest is still advanced when a visitor is \\ninjured on a motorcycle that was purchased in a foreign state \\n \\n14\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 15 of 16                                           \\n        \\nbut was ridden into Illinois.8  After all, Illinois wants to \\nencourage motorcyclists to visit the state of Illinois, even if \\nthey are visiting on motorcycles that are purchased elsewhere.  \\nIllinois’ interest in protecting its tourists would not \\nalone be enough to apply Illinois law.  However, it undermines \\nDefendants’ policy argument that a plaintiff’s home state is the \\nonly jurisdiction that has an interest in compensating the \\nvictims of a product liability action.  As a result, Defendants’ \\npolicy considerations regarding damages are not robust enough to \\novercome the fact that the injury occurred in Illinois, a \\nsubstantial part of the injury causing activity could likely \\nhave occurred in Illinois, and, as a visitor to Illinois, \\nPlaintiff has legitimate contacts with this state.  \\nIII.  \\nADDITIONAL ISSUES \\n \\nPlaintiff has filed a Motion for Leave to File a \\n \\nSupplemental Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion.  \\n[Doc. 230.]  Since the Court has ruled in Plaintiff’s Favor, the \\nrequest for additional briefing is MOOT. \\n \\nFurthermore, Defendants have filed a Motion to Reconsider \\n[Doc. 222] in which they request that this Court grant summary \\n                                                           \\n8 Defendants in this case cannot argue that they had no \\nreasonable expectation that they would ever be subjected to \\nIllinois law.   They have not put forward any evidence that they \\nhave tailored their manufacturing or distribution system to \\navoid liability in Illinois.

For the reasons that follow, Goodyear’s Motion for \\nSummary Judgment will be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 2 of 15                                            \\n       \\nI. \\nBackground \\nThe following facts are undisputed.  On or about May 26, \\n2002, driver William Booker (“Booker”) and passenger McCloud, \\nwere traveling on Booker’s 1985 Honda Goldwing motorcycle, going \\nnorthbound on Interstate 55 in Livingston County, Illinois, when \\nan allegedly defective rear tire “suddenly and catastrophically \\ndeflated,” resulting in personal injuries to both McCloud and \\nBooker.  As a result, on April 21, 2004, McCloud filed claims \\nfor strict liability and negligence against both Goodyear and \\nGoodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd. (“Dunlop”), alleging \\nthat the rear tire of the motorcycle -- which was a Dunlop \\nQualifier K6278150/90B15M/C74H DOT. No. DAWVM711200 -- was \\ndefective and unreasonably dangerous in design and manufacture.  \\nLikewise, on May 18, 2004, Booker also filed a complaint against \\nGoodyear and Dunlop alleging the same claims as McCloud.   \\nIn turn, Goodyear has filed the instant Motion for Summary \\nJudgment, alleging that it was not involved in the design, \\nmanufacture, assembly, advertising, selling, or distribution of \\nthe subject tire in this case.  See [Doc. #154, pg. 5]. \\nII. \\nLegal Standard \\nSummary judgment should be granted where “the pleadings, \\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party \\n  \\n  \\n \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 3 of 15                                            \\n       \\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \\n56(c).  The moving party has the responsibility of informing the \\nCourt as to portions of the record that demonstrate the absence \\nof a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \\n477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  The movant may meet this burden by \\ndemonstrating “that there is an absence of evidence to support \\nthe nonmoving party’s case.”  Id. at 325.   \\n \\nOnce the movant has met its burden, to survive summary \\njudgment the “nonmovant must show through specific evidence that \\na triable issue of fact remains on issues on which [s]he bears \\nthe burden of proof at trial.”  Warsco v. Preferred Tech. Group, \\n258 F.3d 557, 563 (7th Cir. 2001); see also Celotex Corp., 477 \\nU.S. at 322-24.  “The nonmovant may not rest upon mere \\nallegations in the pleadings or upon conclusory statements in \\naffidavits; it must go beyond the pleadings and support its \\ncontentions with proper documentary evidence.”  Chemsource, Inc. \\nv. Hub Group, Inc., 106 F.3d 1358, 1361 (7th Cir. 1997). \\n \\nThis Court must nonetheless “view the record and all \\ninferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the \\n[non-moving party].”  Holland v. Jefferson Nat. Life Ins. Co., \\n883 F.2d 1307, 1312 (7th Cir. 1989).  In doing so, this Court is \\nnot “required to draw every conceivable inference from the \\nrecord -- only those inferences that are reasonable.”  Bank \\nLeumi Le-Isreal, B.M. v. Lee, 928 F.2nd 232, 236 (7th Cir. \\n1991).  Therefore, if the record before the court “could not \\n \\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 4 of 15                                            \\n       \\nlead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party,” \\nthen no genuine issue of material fact exists and, the moving \\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  McClendon v. \\nIndiana Sugars, Inc., 108 F.3d 789, 796 (7th Cir. 1997) (quoting \\nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, \\n587 (1986)).  However, in ruling on a motion for summary \\njudgment, the court may not weigh the evidence or resolve issues \\nof fact; disputed facts must be left for resolution at trial.  \\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986).   \\nIII. \\nAnalysis \\nThe Court first points out the there is a dispute between \\nthe parties as to which legal theory should apply in assessing \\nGoodyear’s liability in the underlying action.  McCloud argues \\nthat Goodyear should be liable for any defects regarding the \\ntire in question, because Goodyear held itself out to the public \\nand its investors as controlling the manufacturing processes and \\nsales at the Tonawanda plant in New York -- where the subject \\ntire was manufactured.  See Aebischer v. Stryker Corp., No. 05-\\n2121, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1619; 2006 WL 44307 (C.D. Ill. Jan. \\n9, 2006) (applying the “holding out theory”).  Goodyear, on the \\nother hand, argues that Aebischer does not apply to the instant \\nmatter but, instead, the Van Dorn test should apply because \\nMcCloud is attempting to pierce the corporate veil. \\n  \\n \\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 5 of 15                                            \\n       \\nA review of McCloud’s complaint against Goodyear reveals a \\n \\nfactual basis to analyze Goodyear’s liability under both the \\n“holding out” theory and the Van Dorn test.  In her Complaint, \\nMcCloud asserts both strict liability and negligence theories of \\nrecovery against Goodyear.  Both theories of recovery, however, \\nhave different applicable legal standards.  See Bittler v. White \\nand Co., Inc., 560 N.E.2d 979, 982 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990). \\n \\nIn cases where a plaintiff attempts to hold a parent \\ncompany liable for the acts of its subsidiary under a negligence \\ntheory, the plaintiff must establish that either one corporation \\nwas the mere instrumentality of the other, or that one \\ncorporation was simply a dummy or sham and that failing to \\nimpose liability would justify a wrong or perpetuate a fraud.  \\nSee Main Bank of Chicago v. Baker, 427 N.E.2d 94, 101 (Ill. \\n1981).  This standard was later named the “Van Dorn” test, after \\nthe Seventh Circuit adopted this approach in Van Dorn Co. v \\nFuture Chemical & Oil Co., 753 F.2d 565 (7th Cir. 1985).  In \\nBaker, the Illinois Supreme Court explained that: \\n[B]efore the separate corporate identity of one \\ncorporation will be disregarded and treated as the \\nalter ego of another, it must be shown that it is so \\ncontrolled and its affairs so conducted that it is a \\nmere instrumentality of another, and it must further \\nappear that observance of the fiction of separate \\nexistence would, under the circumstances, sanction a \\nfraud or promote injustice. Id. at 101. \\nIn support of their contention that the Van Dorn test \\nshould not apply, McCloud relies on Chief District Judge Michael \\n \\n \\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 6 of 15                                            \\n       \\nP. McCuskey’s recent decision in Aebischer v. Stryker Corp., No. \\n05-2121, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1619 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 9, 2006).  \\nAebischer came before the Court on a Motion to Amend the \\nComplaint in which the Plaintiff sought to file an amended \\ncomplaint which alleged that a Defendant held itself out as the \\nmanufacturer of an allegedly defective replacement hip, a \\ntypical product liability claim.  The Court noted that a party \\nholding itself out formed a basis for product liability claims \\n(as discussed below) and allowed the filing of the Amended \\nComplaint, denied Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment and \\nallowed further discovery.  See, Aebischer v. Stryker Corp. 2006 \\nWL 2038545 (C.D.Ill. Jul 19 2006) (considering a later motion to \\ncompel).  The Court did not perform any analysis regarding the \\nnegligence claim. Furthermore, the Court did not hold that the \\nVan Dorn test was not the correct measure for whether a \\nplaintiff should be able to pierce the corporate veil of a \\nparent corporation in a negligence claim. Therefore, Aebischer \\nis distinguishable with regard to Plaintiff’s negligence claim. \\n \\nSince one of McCloud’s claims seeks to impose negligent \\nliability upon Goodyear as a parent corporation for negligence \\ncommitted by, the subsidiary - Dunlop, the Van Dorn test applies \\nto McCloud’s negligence claims.  However, in regard to McCloud’s \\nstrict liability claims, the “holding out” theory is the correct \\nstandard to be applied.  See Connelly v. Uniroyal, Inc., 389 \\nN.E.2d 155 (Ill. 1979); see Also, Hebel v. Sherman Equipment, \\n \\n6\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 7 of 15                                            \\n       \\n442 N.E.2d 199 (Ill. 1982).  In all the Illinois cases in which \\na court has applied the “holding out” theory, the plaintiff was \\nproceeding against the defendant based on a products \\nliability/strict liability claim.  See Ogg v. City of \\nSpringfield, 458 N.E.2d 1331 (Ill. App. Ct. 1984); see also, \\nRoot v. JH Industries, Inc., 660 N.E.2d 195 (Ill. App. Ct. \\n1995); Hebel, 442 N.E.2d 199; Connelly, 370 N.E.2d 1189.  \\nAccordingly, the Court will first address Goodyear’s liability \\nas to Plaintiffs’ negligence claim under the Van Dorn test, and \\nthen Goodyear’s liability as to McCloud’s strict liability \\nclaims under the “holding out” theory. \\nA.  The “Van Dorn” Test \\n \\nIn cases where a plaintiff has attempted to hold a parent \\ncompany liable for the acts of its subsidiary for negligence, \\ncourts have repeatedly applied the Van Dorn test.  See Connelly, \\n370 N.E.2d at 1196;  Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Pepper Source, \\n941 F.2d 519 (7th Cir. 1991); Torco Oil Co. v. Innovative \\nThermal Corp., 763 F.Supp. 1445 (N.D.Ill. 1991); See also, Van \\nDorn, 753 F.2d at 569, 570.  In Van Dorn, the Seventh Circuit \\nheld that generally: \\n  “[u]nder Illinois law, a corporation is a legal \\nentity separate and distinct from its shareholders, \\ndirectors and officers, and, generally, from other \\ncorporations with which it may be affiliated.  \\nHowever, a corporate entity will be disregarded and \\nthe veil of limited liability pierced when two \\nrequirements are met: First, there must be such unity \\nof interest and ownership that the separate \\npersonalities of the corporation and the individual \\n \\n7\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 8 of 15                                            \\n       \\n[or other corporation] no longer exist; and second, \\ncircumstances must be such that adherence to the \\nfiction of a separate corporate existence would \\nsanction a fraud or promote injustice.”   \\n \\nId. at 569, 570 (citations omitted). \\n \\n1.  Unity of Interest \\n \\n“Stock control and the existence of common officers and \\ndirectors are generally prerequisites to the piercing of the \\ncorporate veil although these factors alone will not suffice.”  \\nHystro Products, Inc. v. MNP Corp., 18 F.3d 1384, 1389 (7th Cir. \\n1994)(citations omitted).  This is because, “[t]heoretically, \\nevery parent corporation, by virtue of its ownership interest, \\nhas the power, right, and ability to control the products of its \\nsubsidiary.”  Bunch v. Centeon, L.L.C., No. 99-C3511, 2000 U.S. \\nDist. LEXIS 17144, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 24, 2000).  Therefore, \\n“to hold a parent company liable for acts by a subsidiary, the \\nlegal separateness of the parent and subsidiary must have been \\ndisregarded in a wide range of matters.”  Bunch, 2000 U.S. Dist. \\nLEXIS 17144, at *6.   \\n \\nIn determining whether the requisite degree of control is \\nmaintained by one corporation over the affairs of another to \\njustify disregarding their separate corporate identities, the \\nIllinois courts have considered some of the following factors: \\n“(1) the failure to maintain adequate corporate records or to \\ncomply with corporate formalities, (2) the commingling of funds \\nor assets, (3) undercapitalization, and (4) one corporation \\n \\n8\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 9 of 15                                            \\n       \\ntreating the assets of another corporation as its own.”  Van \\nDorn, 753 F.2d at 570.  Some more factors that have also been \\nconsidered include: Who controlled the day-to-day operations, \\nmanufacturing and design processes, did the two corporations \\nshare the same employees, who controlled payroll, and, did the \\ntwo corporations have separate facilities?  Id. at 572; See \\nalso, Hystro Products, Inc., 18 F.3d at 1389. \\n \\nIn considering the first four factors as applied to the \\ncase at hand, it is unclear from the record whether Dunlop \\nfailed to maintain adequate corporate records or comply with \\ncorporate formalities, or that Dunlop was even undercapitalized.  \\nThe record, however, does indicate that Goodyear reported \\nDunlop’s profits and assets as their own.  In regards to the \\nother considerations, Plaintiffs’ allege that the policies and \\nprocedures for the operation of Dunlop’s business, including \\nproduct quality and safety of the tires it manufactures, have \\nbeen controlled by Goodyear since 1999.  However, the record to \\nwhich Plaintiffs’ cite to in support of this contention is \\nmerely a business conduct manual, and does not in any way \\nindicate whether Goodyear controls the day-to-day operations, \\nmanufacturing, and design processes of Dunlop.  Goodyear’s \\nfinancial report only indicates that after they acquired 75% of \\nDunlop’s interest, that in order to maximize market growth \\nopportunities, they effected a plan that included the downsizing \\nor consolidation of manufacturing, sales, support and \\n \\n9\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 10 of 15                                           \\n        \\ndistribution operations.  This definitely suggests that Goodyear \\ncontrolled the marketing processes, however, there is nothing \\nelse in the record that indicates whether they specifically \\ncontrolled the manufacturing and design processes at Dunlop’s \\nTonawanda Plant on a day-to-day basis.  Goodyear’s website \\nmerely indicates that Dunlop’s Tonawanda plant is a part of the \\nGoodyear family of companies which does not suggest that they \\ncontrolled Dunlop’s Tonawanda plant’s manufacturing, operation, \\nand design processes. \\n \\nGoodyear and Dunlop did not share the same employees, and \\nDunlop even had their own headquarters located in West Amherst, \\nNew York.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that \\nGoodyear has made a warranty of any kind to any person with \\nrespect to the specific tire in question, or even to motorcycle \\ntires period.  In fact, Dunlop manufactured the tire in question \\nin their Tonawanda plant, which meant that Goodyear neither \\nmanufactured nor was in possession of the tire in question at \\nany time.  Accordingly, the Court must find, with respect to \\nPlaintiffs’ \\nnegligence \\nclaims, \\nthat \\ndespite \\nGoodyear’s \\nsubstantial ownership of Dunlop’s stock, these two corporations \\nhave always operated as separate entities and continue to do so \\ntoday.  Therefore, the Court finds no basis on which to find \\nthat there is unity of interest and ownership that the separate \\npersonalities of Goodyear and Dunlop should be disregarded. \\n2.  Fraud or the Promotion of an Injustice \\n \\n10\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 11 of 15                                           \\n        \\nEven if the Court finds Goodyear to have sufficient control \\n \\nover Dunlop, to hold them liable for the negligent acts of \\nDunlop, the Plaintiffs have still not offered any proof of fraud \\nor that an injustice will result if they are not allowed to also \\nhold Goodyear liable.  The Van Dorn court held that, “[o]nce the \\nfirst element of the test is established, either the sanctioning \\nof a fraud (intentional wrongdoing) or the promotion of \\ninjustice, will satisfy the second element.  Van Dorn, 753 F.2d \\nat 570.  In order to satisfy the second requirement, Plaintiffs’ \\nmust establish more than the inability to collect on their \\njudgment.  Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Pepper Source, 993 F.2d 1309, \\n1311 (7th Cir. 1993).  Plaintiffs’ must establish a “wrong” such \\nas where: \\n“the common sense rules of adverse possession would be \\nundermined; former partners would be permitted to \\nskirt the legal rules concerning monetary obligations; \\na party would be unjustly enriched; a parent \\ncorporation that caused a sub’s liabilities and its \\ninability to pay for them would escape those \\nliabilities; or an intentional scheme to squirrel \\nassets into a liability-free corporation while heaping \\nliabilities upon an asset-free corporation would be \\nsuccessful.” \\n \\nId. at 1311, 1312 (quoting Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Pepper \\nSource, 941 F.2d 519, 524 (7th Cir. 1991)). \\n \\nIn the present case, Plaintiff, McCloud conceded that she \\nwas not able to find any evidence that would show, “that \\nadherence to the fiction of separate corporate existence,” in \\nthis case, “would sanction a fraud or promote injustice.” \\n \\n11\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 12 of 15                                           \\n        \\nCiting, Van Dorn, 753 F.2d at 569-70.  And since Plaintiff, \\nBooker, failed to respond to this Court’s order requesting \\nevidence to satisfy the second prong of the Van Dorn test, this \\nCourt concludes that Plaintiffs’ have failed to provide evidence \\nfrom which a reasonable jury could conclude that the second \\nprong of the Van Dorn test has been satisfied.  Accordingly, the \\nCourt grants Goodyear’s motion for summary judgment in part, as \\nit relates to Plaintiffs’ negligence claims against Goodyear. \\nB.  “Holding Out” Theory \\n \\nUnder Illinois law, “the law is clear that a company which \\nholds itself out to the public as the manufacturer of a product \\nis liable for the injuries caused by that product if it is found \\nto be unreasonably dangerous.”  Ogg, 458 N.E.2d at 1336 \\n(citations omitted).  In the past, the aim of the “holding out” \\ntheory or “apparent manufacturer” doctrine, was to provide a \\nremedy for consumers injured by unsafe products.  Hebel, 442 \\nN.E.2d at 202.  This same objective is now “achieved by the \\ndoctrine of strict products liability.”  Id.  In other words, \\n“[t]he function of the apparent-manufacturer doctrine has, as it \\nwere, been absorbed by the theory of sellers’ strict liability \\nin tort for injuries caused by unreasonably unsafe products.”  \\nId.  The Supreme Court of Illinois has held that: \\n“The primary rationale for imposing liability on the \\napparent manufacturer of a defective product is that \\nit has induced the purchasing public to believe that \\nit is the actual manufacturer, and to act on this \\nbelief-that is, to purchase the product in reliance on \\n \\n12\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 13 of 15                                           \\n        \\nthe apparent manufacturer’s reputation and skill in \\nmaking it.” \\n \\nId. at 203 (emphasis included). \\nTherefore, “whether a holding out has occurred must be \\njudged from the viewpoint of the purchasing public, and in light \\nof circumstances as of the time of purchase.”  Id.  Another \\nrationale which justifies imposing strict liability on \\nmanufacturers, “is based on the fact that [the manufacturers], \\nas part of the chain of distribution, are involved in and reap a \\nprofit from the placement of the allegedly defective product \\ninto the stream of commerce.”  Bittler, 560 N.E.2d at 981 \\n(citing Hebel, 442 N.E.2d 199).  Furthermore,  \\n“[e]ven parties who are not within the actual chain of \\ndistribution, but who play an integral role in the \\nmarketing enterprise of an allegedly defective product \\nand participate in the profits derived from placing \\nthe product into the stream of commerce, are held \\nliable under the doctrine of strict liability.” \\n \\nId. (citing Connelly, 389 N.E.2d 155). \\nIn the present case, the record definitely shows that \\nGoodyear reports Dunlop’s profits as their own, thereby \\nsupporting the notion that Goodyear reaps the profits from the \\ntires that Dunlop manufacturers and sells.  Whether Goodyear \\nprofits from Dunlop’s manufacture of motorcycle tires–-\\nspecifically, the tire in question–-is, however, disputable.  \\nThomas Johnson, Jr., the tire performance manager at Dunlop in \\n2005, stated that he “believed” the motorcycle operations at \\n  \\n  \\n \\n13\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 14 of 15                                           \\n        \\nDunlop were a separate entity from Goodyear’s purchase of \\nDunlop.   \\nHowever, a belief is not the same as actual knowledge, and \\nthere is nothing in the record that either proves or disproves \\nhis statement.  It is disputable whether Goodyear plays an \\nintegral role in the marketing of the allegedly defective tire.  \\nGoodyear took over the marketing of Dunlop, which includes the \\nsale of Dunlop products.  However, there is nothing in the \\nrecord to indicate whether Goodyear also took over the \\nmotorcycle division of Dunlop.  The record only states that \\nGoodyear acquired 75% of Dunlop’s interest, and with it, \\nDunlop’s tire sales and distribution operations.  The record \\ndoes not indicate which tire sales or distribution operations.   \\n \\nSummary judgment should be granted “where the pleadings, \\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, \\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine \\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is \\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \\n56(c).  If a material question of fact does exist, the Court \\nmust not grant summary judgment.   \\nIn this case, there are disputable questions of fact as to \\nwhether Goodyear was marketing Dunlop’s motorcycle operations \\nwhen they were marketing Dunlop’s products.  Based upon the \\nevidence before the Court, a reasonable jury could conclude that \\n \\n14\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 15 of 15                                           \\n        \\nGoodyear was marketing Dunlop tires and was holding itself out \\nas the apparent manufacturer of Dunlop motorcycle tires. \\nAccordingly, this Court must deny Goodyear’s Motion for \\nSummary Judgment in part, as it relates to Plaintiffs’ strict \\nliability claims.  \\n  \\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendant’s Motion for Summary \\nJudgment [Doc. # 154] be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  \\nSummary Judgment is GRANTED in favor of Defendant on Count III \\nand DENIED as to Counts I and II.  \\nENTERED this   11th     day of December, 2006. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    s/ Joe Billy McDade___       \\n       Joe Billy McDade \\n United States District Judge \\n15', '1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 195    Page 1 of 3                                             \\nE-FILED\\n      \\n Monday, 14 August, 2006  08:59:03 AM \\n Clerk, U.S. District Court, ILCD\\nCase.

For the reasons that follow,\\nBooker’s Motion will be GRANTED.\\nOn August 5, 2005, Booker filed a motion for summary judgment\\non Defendants’ counterclaim for contribution pursuant to Illinois\\nstate law in connection with the claims of Plaintiff Trish Lee\\nMcCloud (“McCloud”).  In his Motion, Booker argued that Defendants’\\ncontribution claim was barred by the Illinois Joint Tortfeasor\\nDefendants.\\n---------------------------\\nWILLIAM BOOKER,\\nPlaintiff,\\nv.\\nGOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES NORTH\\nAMERICA, LTD. and THE \\nGOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER\\nCOMPANY,\\nDefendants.\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 195    Page 2 of 3                                             \\n      \\nContribution Act (“Contribution Act”) since McCloud’s claim against\\nBooker was settled in good faith.  Defendants failed to respond to\\nBooker’s Motion and, on September 23, 2005, this Court held that\\nthere was no genuine issue as to any material fact in dispute and,\\nthat Booker’s settlement with McCloud was fair, reasonable and “in\\ngood faith” within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Contribution\\nAct.  740 ILCS 100/2(c).  Accordingly, summary judgment was granted\\nin favor of Booker.\\nBooker has now filed the instant Motion requesting the Court\\nto enter a partial final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the\\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  And, again, Defendants have\\nfailed to respond.\\nRule 54(b) permits a court to enter a partial final judgment\\n“when a distinct claim has been fully resolved with respect to all\\nparties[,]” and there is no just reason for delay.  Lottie v. West\\nAmerican Ins. Co., 408 F.3d 935, 938-39 (7th Cir. 2005)(quotations\\nomitted).  A claim is not distinct or separate if the claim “so\\noverlaps the claim or claims that have been retained for trial that\\nif the later were to give rise to a separate appeal at the end of\\nthe case the court would have to go over the same ground that it\\nhad covered in the first appeal.”  Id. at 939 (quoting Lawyers\\nTitle Ins. Corp. v. Dearborn Title Corp., 118 F.3d 1157, 1162 (7th\\nCir. 1997).  In other words, a claim is separate from the remaining\\nclaims if there is minimal factual overlap.  Id. \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 195    Page 3 of 3                                             \\n      \\nIn the present case, the underlying legal issue as to whether\\nthis Court correctly interpreted the Contribution Act when granting\\nsummary judgment in favor of Booker is separate and distinct from\\nthe remaining claims which allege that the accident in question\\nresulted from a defectively manufactured tire.  Thus, the appellate\\ncourt would not need “to go over the same ground” if Defendants’\\ncontribution claim is appealed now and the remaining claims are\\nappealed later.

In \\nparticular, McCloud argues that Exhibits 7 and 17 attached to her \\nMemorandum of Law and Evidence in Opposition to Defendants’ \\nMotion to Bar the Testimony of Derian, Woehrle and Kasner [Doc. \\n#170] are confidential documents which must be filed under seal \\npursuant to paragraph 9 of the Protective Order entered in this \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 183    Page 2 of 3                                             \\n      \\ncase on July 27, 2005 [Doc. #71].  But, paragraph 9 clearly \\nstates as follows: \\nIf confidential documents are to be filed in \\nsupport of a motion, or used at trial, the parties \\nshall, before filing the documents or filing a motion \\nto seal the documents, make a good faith effort to \\nredact the confidential information in such a manner \\nthat the document still contains the information \\nrequired for the Court’s consideration. Only if \\nredaction is not possible may a party move for leave \\nto file the document under seal. The motion shall \\nexplain how the document(s) in question meet the \\nstandards for filing sealed documents as discussed in \\nCitizens First Nat’l Bank of Princeton v. Cincinnati \\nIns. Co., 178 F.3d 943 (7th Cir. 1999), and its \\nprogeny. \\nAny motion for leave to file documents under \\nseal, together with supporting information, shall be \\nsubmitted for an in camera review to the presiding \\njudge via email at the email addresses specified in \\nthe Central District’s Administrative Procedures for \\nFiling, Signing, and Verifying Pleadings and Papers by \\nelectronic Means in Civil Cases, § III.

(Doc. 480).  For the following reasons, \\nRespondent’s Objections to and Motion for Reconsideration of the Magistrate’s \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 2 of 9', 'Order (Doc. 479) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  It is granted to the \\nextent that the Court herein reconsiders portions of Magistrate Judge Gorman’s \\nOrder, however all of its objections are DENIED.  Magistrate Judge Gorman’s \\nOrder is AFFIRMED, and Petitioner’s Lien is to be paid in full. \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\nThe underlying litigation in this matter began in 2004, when Respondent \\nTrish Lee McCloud filed suit against Goodyear Dunlop Tires for injuries she \\nsustained in a motorcycle accident.  (Doc. 1).  Respondent’s claim was tried to a jury, \\nand the jury rendered a verdict in her favor, awarding her damages in the amount', 'of $15,000,000.14.  (Doc. 378 at 2).  Of this total award, $472,794.14 was for the \\n“reasonable value of necessary medical care, treatment, services and life care needs \\nof [Respondent] to the present time.”  (Doc. 378 at 1).  The verdict was appealed \\n(Doc. 422) and the parties reached a settlement, which was approved by this Court \\non December 10, 2008 (Doc. 436).   \\n \\nFollowing the settlement of the case, Petitioner, OSF Healthcare System \\nd/b/a Saint Francis Medical Center (“OSF”), filed a Petition to Adjudicate a Lien \\npursuant to the Health Care Services Lien Act, 770 ILCS 23/1 et. seq., seeking to \\nrecover the $261,902.33 that it had billed to Respondent for medical goods and', 'services provided to her after her motorcycle accident.  (Doc. 445). After ordering \\nfuller briefing addressing the merits of the Petition (Doc. 448), as well as the Court’s \\njurisdiction over it (Text Order of 12/18/09), the Court determined that it had  \\nancillary jurisdiction over the Petition pursuant to the settlement agreement, and \\n \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 3 of 9                                             \\n      \\nreferred the matter to Magistrate Judge Gorman for further post-judgment \\nproceedings related thereto.  (Doc. 454 at 3-4).   \\n \\nSubsequently, Magistrate Judge Gorman presided over all matters relating', 'to the Petition to Adjudicate Liens, including allowing the withdrawal of \\nPetitioner’s Motion for Sanctions (Text Order of 3/4/2010), denying a Motion to \\nCompel Discovery filed by Respondent (Doc. 469), and ordering that Petitioner’s lien \\nbe paid in full (Doc. 478).  It is this final order, which adjudicated Petitioner’s lien \\nand determined that it should be paid in full, to which Respondent now objects.  \\n(Doc. 479).  Respondent argues that Magistrate Judge Gorman did not have \\njurisdiction to enter such an order, and that the order is erroneous and contrary to \\nlaw.   \\nI. Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Jurisdiction', 'Section 636 of Title 28 of the United States Code sets forth the jurisdiction of \\na United States Magistrate Judge.  According to that statute, a magistrate judge \\nhas jurisdiction to hear and determine various pretrial matters of a non-dispositive \\nnature upon designation by the district judge.  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A).  Further, \\nupon the consent of the parties, a magistrate judge may conduct any or all \\nproceedings in a nonjury civil matter and order entry of judgment in the case, when \\nspecially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court.  § 636(c)(1).  \\nConsent under § 636(c)(1) may be either express or inferred from the parties’', 'conduct during litigation.  Roell v. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580 (2003).  Where a litigant \\nis “made aware of the need for consent and the right to refuse it, and still \\nvoluntarily appear[s] to try the case before the Magistrate Judge” consent is \\n \\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 4 of 9                                             \\n      \\nproperly inferred, and the Magistrate Judge has jurisdiction.  Id. at 590.  Finally, “a \\nmagistrate judge may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent \\nwith the Constitution and laws of the United States.” § 636(b)(3).  \\n   \\nRespondent argues that Magistrate Judge Gorman did not have jurisdiction', 'to enter judgment on the Petition to Adjudicate Liens under § 636(c).  Specifically, \\nRespondent states that there was never any indication that the Petition was \\nreferred to Magistrate Judge Gorman for the purposes of entering judgment, and \\nthat therefore Respondent did not consent to his doing so.  (Doc. 479 at 2-3).  \\nTherefore, Respondent argues that the Court should treat Magistrate Judge \\nGorman’s order as a proposed finding and recommendation pursuant to § \\n636(b)(1)(B), and engage in a de novo review of the portions of his order to which \\nRespondent now objects.  (Doc. 479 at 3).   \\n \\nPetitioner responds that Magistrate Judge Gorman did, in fact, have', 'jurisdiction over their Petition to Adjudicate Liens pursuant to § 636(c)(1), and that \\ntherefore his order must be treated as the final judgment of this Court.  (Doc. 480 at \\n2).  According to Petitioner, the parties impliedly consented to Magistrate Judge \\nGorman’s jurisdiction pursuant to § 636(c)(1) due to the fact that they voluntarily \\nproceeded before him on numerous occasions after this Court referred the matter to \\nhim in its Order and Opinion of January 14, 2010.  (Doc. 480 at 2-3).  Because \\nRespondent never objected to Magistrate Gorman’s jurisdiction prior to his final \\norder adjudicating the lien, Petitioner maintains that the parties consented to his', 'jurisdiction, and cannot now complain simply because his final decision was adverse \\nto them.  (Doc. 480 at 2). \\n \\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 5 of 9                                             \\n      \\n \\nThe Court is confused over this dispute as Magistrate Judge Gorman never \\nentered any judgment, but instead issued an Order on Petitioner’s Petition to \\nAdjudicate Liens, as was referred to him by this Court.  This is undoubtedly not a \\ncase to which the parties consented pursuant to §636(c)(1), as the parties were \\nnever made aware of the need to formally consent to the Magistrate Judge’s \\njurisdiction; nor did they ever expressly do so.  Instead, because the power to', 'adjudicate liens is not expressly granted in either the federal statute or this Court’s \\nLocal Rules, the Court finds that the case was properly referred to Magistrate \\nJudge Gorman pursuant to § 636(b)(3), the catch-all provision of the Federal \\nMagistrates Act, which allows for the referral of any matter which is not \\ninconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.    \\n \\nBecause the adjudication of Petitioner’s lien was dispositive of Petitioner’s \\nclaim, it is appropriate to adopt the standard of review for dispositive pretrial \\nmatters: a de novo review upon the record.  Talbott v. Empress River Casino, 1997', 'WL 458537, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 4, 1997).  “A de novo review does not require a new \\nhearing, but the Court must give fresh consideration to those issues to which \\nspecific objections have been made.”  Id. (internal quotations omitted).  Accordingly, \\nthe Court will take a fresh look at the portions of Judge Gorman’s Order to which \\nRespondent has now objected.     \\nII. Objections to Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Order \\n \\nThe first objection Respondent makes to Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Order of \\nJuly 13, 2010 (Doc. 478) is that he found that the Illinois “common fund doctrine” \\ndid not apply to hospital liens.  In making this determination, Magistrate Judge \\n \\n5', '1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 6 of 9                                             \\n      \\nGorman disregarded an Illinois Court of Appeals for the Fifth District decision, \\nHowell v. Dunaway, 924 N.E.2d 1190 (Ill. App. 2010), which diverged from previous \\nIllinois law and held that the doctrine did, in fact, apply to hospital liens such as \\nthose asserted by Petitioner.  However, since the time Respondent filed her \\nobjections, the Illinois Supreme Court has issued an opinion reversing the Fifth \\nDistrict’s opinion, and explicitly holding that, in Illinois, the common fund doctrine \\nis not applicable to health care liens under the Health Care Services Lien Act.', 'Wendling v. Southern Ill. Hosp. Svcs., ---N.E.2d ---, 2011 WL 1085186 (Ill. March 24, \\n2011).  Accordingly, Magistrate Judge Gorman’s prediction of Illinois law was fully \\ncorrect and Respondent’s first objection to his Order of July 13, 2010 (Doc. 478) \\nfails.1    \\n \\nIn addition, Respondent argues that she raised three other claims before \\nMagistrate Judge Gorman, which he rejected without articulating his reasons for \\ndoing so.  These claims include:  1) Petitioner’s claim should be reduced because its \\ncharges for Ms. McCloud’s treatment were substantially higher than Petitioner \\nwould have received for the same services provided to an insured patient, or if it', 'had timely sought reimbursement for all of its charges from Michigan Medicaid, \\nbecause otherwise Petitioner would be unjustly enriched to the detriment of \\nRespondent; 2) Petitioner’s lien claim should be denied because Petitioner has not \\n                                                           \\n1Respondent concedes that her objection to Magistrate Judge Gorman’s \\ndetermination regarding applicability of the common fund doctrine to health care \\nliens would fail if the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the Fifth District’s decision in \\nHowell. (Doc. 479 at 6).  Specifically, Respondent invited the Court to “defer final', 'adjudication of the lien pending a decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in the \\nHowell case, at which point, any uncertainty regarding the state of Illinois law on \\nthis subject will be resolved.”  (Doc. 479 at 6).   \\n \\n6\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 7 of 9                                             \\n      \\nsatisfied its burden that the amount of the lien is reasonable and because \\nRespondent was denied an opportunity to make discovery on that issue; and 3) \\nPetitioner’s acceptance of Medicaid reimbursement for a portion of its charges bars \\nits current claim for reimbursement from Respondent.  (Doc. 479 at 4-5).  Although', 'Respondent makes no arguments in support of these claims in its current \\nObjections, because the Court is performing a de novo review on the record, it will \\nlook to the parties’ briefs before Magistrate Judge Gorman in order to determine \\nwhether Respondent’s claims are with or without merit.   \\nA. Reduction of Claim to Amount That Would Be Paid by Insurance \\nRespondent’s first argument is that Petitioner’s Lien should have been \\nreduced to the amount that Petitioner would have received in reimbursement had \\nthey billed the services to either public or private insurance.  (Doc. 472 at 8).  Ms. \\nMcCloud did not have private insurance, however she may have been eligible for', 'Medicaid coverage, and there is evidence that Petitioner filed a claim with Michigan \\nMedicaid to recover payment. (Doc. 472 Exh. A).  There is also evidence that had \\nMedicaid allowed Petitioner’s claim, which it instead denied as being untimely filed, \\nit would have paid in the amount of $130,951.17.  (Doc. 472 Exh. A).  Therefore, \\nRespondent argues that Petitioner would now be unjustly enriched if it is allowed to \\nrecover more than the $130,951.17 it would have received had it timely filed its \\nclaim with Michigan Medicaid.   \\nSeveral federal cases have discussed whether or not a hospital should be \\nallowed to assert a lien against a patient’s recovery from a third party tortfeasor', 'when that hospital has already recovered a portion of its bills from Medicaid.  All of \\n \\n7\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 8 of 9                                             \\n      \\nthese cases have held that when a hospital bills and accepts payment from \\nMedicaid, its claim must be treated as paid in full, and it may no longer seek to \\nrecover any fees from the patient or any other party.  See Evanston Hosp. v. Hauck, \\n1 F.3d 540 (7th Cir. 1993); Miller v. Gorski Wladyslaw Estate, 547 F.3d 273 (5th Cir. \\n2008).  Conversely, these cases indicate that when the hospital has not accepted \\npayment from Medicaid, it is free to seek full recovery from the patient.  See id.', 'Here, because Michigan Medicaid denied its claim, Petitioner never actually \\naccepted payment from Michigan Medicaid, thus leaving all of Petitioner’s bills \\nunpaid.  Respondent argues that, nevertheless, Petitioner should be barred from \\nrecovering a greater amount now as it would be in essence receiving a windfall for \\nits failure to timely file its claim with Michigan Medicaid.  While this may be the \\ncase, because Petitioner never actually accepted payment from Michigan Medicaid, \\nprecedent dictates that it is free to seek full recovery from Respondent or any other \\nthird party source.  Accordingly, Respondent’s second objection also fails.', 'B. Whether The Amount of the Lien is Reasonable and Necessary \\nNext, Respondent argues that Petitioner’s Lien should be denied because \\nPetitioner did not satisfy its burden of showing that its charges were reasonable or \\ncustomary.  (Doc. 472 at 11).  However, as Magistrate Judge Gorman found in his \\nOrder denying Respondent’s Motion to Compel Discovery (Doc. 469) on this issue, \\nthe bills upon which Petitioner now seeks to recover were presented to the jury as \\npart of Respondent’s damages at trial.  Moreover, the jury there found that \\nRespondent’s medical bills were reasonable.  (Doc. 378 at 1).  Respondent may not', 'rely upon Petitioner’s medical bills as part of its case before the jury, but now, when \\n \\n8\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 9 of 9                                             \\n      \\nPetitioner seeks to recover upon them, dispute that they were not reasonable or \\nnecessary.   Therefore, this objection also fails.   \\nC. Prior Acceptance of Payment \\nFinally, Respondent argues that Petitioner should be barred from recovering \\non its lien because “it is apparent that one of the bills for services rendered to Ms. \\nMcCloud was submitted by [P]etitioner to Michigan Medicaid for reimbursement in \\ntimely fashion and the claim was paid.”  (Doc. 472 at 15).

That motorcycle accident is the subject of this\\nlitigation. The billed amount for those goods and services was $261,902.33. When this lawsuit was\\nfiled, OSF served a lien against the injury claim for that amount. \\nTrish McCloud’s claim was tried to a jury, which rendered a Verdict in her favor, awarding\\ndamages in the amount of $15,000,000.14. That Verdict was itemized; the amount awarded for\\npayment of past medical care, treatment, services and life care needs was $472,794.14. (See Verdict,\\nDoc. #378). That amount, which included the OSF bills, was presented by the Plaintiff as part of', 'stipulated medical expenses, the reasonableness of which was undisputed at trial.\\nThe Verdict was appealed, and on appeal the parties participated in the Seventh Circuit’s\\nsettlement process. The case was settled for a confidential amount. The settlement was approved by\\nthe Court on December 10, 2008. The approval included attorney’s fees of 40% of the settlement\\namount plus expenses, which totaled $551,811.73.\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 2 of 6                                             \\n      \\nAfter the settlement fund was established and paid, Plaintiff’s lawyers and OSF lawyers began', \"negotiations over satisfaction of the lien. They have been unsuccessful in resolving their differences.\\nOSF maintains that it is entitled to the entire amount of its lien, while Plaintiff contends that the\\nsettlement amount is subject to the common fund doctrine1 and should accordingly be reduced by 40%\\nfor attorney fees and by pro-rata litigation expenses.\\n OSF seeks adjudication of its lien pursuant to the Healthcare Services Lien Act2, 770 ILCS\\n23/30, which provides in pertinent part:\\n§ 30. Adjudication of rights. On petition filed by the injured person or the health care\\nprofessional or health care provider and on the petitioner's written notice to all interested\", 'adverse parties, the circuit court shall adjudicate the rights of all interested parties and enforce\\ntheir liens. \\nUnder this Act, so long as the total amount of liens is less than 40% of the verdict or\\nsettlement, the lien is enforceable. 770 ILCS 23/10(c). There is no dispute between Plaintiff and OSF\\nthat the amount of liens is less than 40% of the settlement. What is not clear, however, is whether the\\nlien is subject to the common fund doctrine. \\nThe question whether the common fund doctrine applies to liens of medical providers was\\nmentioned in Baier v. State Farm Ins. Co., 361 N.E.2d 1100 (Ill.1977). In that case, the plaintiff was', 'an attorney who had represented a plaintiff in an automobile accident case. His client’s insurer had\\npaid his client $1000, which was the policy limit for medical bills. To obtain that amount, his client\\n1In an Order entered earlier in this case (See Order, Doc. #469), a motion to compel was\\ndenied. In that Order, the Court found specifically that Plaintiff would not be allowed to challenge\\nthe jury’s finding that Plaintiff’s medical bills, including those from OSF, were reasonable and\\ncustomary, either directly or indirectly. Plaintiff’s indirect challenges were based on what an\\ninsured patient would have paid and what Medicaid would have paid. In the briefing regarding', 'adjudication of the OSF lien, these issues were again raised; they are again rejected. \\n2This case is in federal court on diversity jurisdiction, so Illinois law governing liens\\napplies to this dispute. \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 3 of 6                                             \\n      \\nhad signed a document reflecting that the payment was a “loan” to be repaid only “in the event and\\nto the extent that any net recovery is made” from a tortfeasor. The document also required the insured\\nto sue if there was a basis for doing so. Suit was filed and the insurer notified the other driver’s insurer\\nthat it claimed $1000 subrogation rights from any proceeds in the case.', 'The attorney obtained a settlement of $12,000. The other driver’s insurer paid in 2 drafts: one\\nfor $11,000 payable to the attorney and his client and one for $1000 payable to the insurer for $1000.\\nIn the course of deciding whether the common fund doctrine applied to the subrogor/subrogee\\nrelationship (the Supreme Court held that it did), the Baier Court noted that the insurer had\\nhypothesized that if the doctrine applied to the subrogor/ subrogee relationship, then it might also\\napply to a medical provider who had rendered medical services. Because the case before it did not\\npresent that question, the Court declined to consider it. 361 N.E.2d at 1102. In reaching its decision,', 'the Baier Court commented that the common fund doctrine is based on the “equitable concept that an\\nattorney who performs services in creating a fund should in equity and good conscience be allowed\\ncompensation out of the whole fund from all those who seek to benefit from it.” 361 N.E.2d at 1102.\\nShortly after Baier was decided, the issue of whether the common fund doctrine applies to\\nhospital liens presented itself squarely. In Maynard v. Parker, 387 N.E.2d 298 (Ill.1979), the plaintiff\\nsued for injuries sustained in a car accident. His damages included $11,027.96 for his hospital bill.\\nUnder the then-extant hospital liens act, the hospital noticed its lien. The case settled for $37,500.', 'Defendant’s insurer issued a draft for $11,027.96 to the Plaintiff, his wife, his attorney and the\\nhospital. The hospital then filed its petition to adjudicate the rights of the parties to that amount. The\\ntrial court ordered that the hospital pay from the total amount one-third of the costs incurred ($205.48)\\nand one-third of the total for attorney’s fees. The hospital appealed, and the appellate court reversed.\\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 4 of 6                                             \\n      \\nBefore the Supreme Court, the plaintiff argued that the trial court had properly applied the\\ncommon fund doctrine. The Supreme Court rejected that argument, finding two “important', 'distinctions” between the case before it and Baier. First, the types of relationships between the parties\\nin Baier differed significantly: “Here, the plaintiff’s liability to the hospital was not dependent upon\\nthe creation of a fund; plaintiff was a debtor obligated to pay for the services rendered by the hospital\\nout of any resources which might become available to him.” Id. at 300. Unlike Baier, where the\\nsubrogor and subrogee stood in the same shoes, the Plaintiff and the hospital had entirely separate\\nlegal interests and obligations. Second, there was no limitation on the amount of the lien that could', 'be claimed in Baier, whereas the amount of the lien in Maynard could not, pursuant to the Lien Act,\\n“exceed one-third of the sum paid or due to said injured person...” Id, quoting Ill. Rev. Stat.1975, ch.\\n82 ¶ 97. Because of these two distinctions, the Court concluded that the common fund doctrine was\\nnot applicable to hospital liens.\\nThe common fund doctrine again reached the State Supreme Court in Bishop v. Burgard, 764\\nN.E.2d 24 (Ill.2002). In that case, an employee sued the driver of the other vehicle involved in a car\\naccident that had injured the employee. She signed a contingency agreement with her attorney. The', 'employee’s medical bills, totaling $8,576.30, had been paid by the employer’s medical plan, which\\nhad noticed its lien in that amount against the proceeds of the lawsuit. The case settled for $21,500.\\nPlaintiff’s attorney was unsuccessful in efforts to have the Plan reduce its lien by one-third to reflect\\nattorney’s fees, so he filed a petition to adjudicate the lien. The issues presented included whether\\nERISA preempted the doctrine in this context and, if not, whether the doctrine applied or whether the\\nterms of the plan prevailed. In addition, if the terms of the plan prevailed, there remained the question\\nwhether the terms of the plan were unenforceable as a violation of public policy.', 'The Bishop Court relied on Ragan v. Columbia Mutual Ins. Co., 701 N.E.2d 493 (1998), which\\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 5 of 6                                             \\n      \\nhad held that ERISA does not preempt the common fund doctrine. Finding nothing in the case before\\nit that would call Scholtens into question either substantively or on the facts, the Court applied\\nScholtens. The Court emphasized that ERISA does not preempt the doctrine because the claim for\\nattorney’s fees arises independently of both the benefit plan and the subrogation agreement. Bishop,\\n764 N.E.2d at 31. See Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Svc. Inc., 486 U.S. 825, 833 n.8', '(1988)(noting in dicta that common fund claims for attorney’s fees are not preempted by ERISA).\\nFurthermore, because of its independent nature, a common fund claim for attorney’s fees is not\\ngoverned by the terms of the plan. Bishop, 764 N.E.2d at 34.\\nA few months ago, the Illinois Court of Appeals for the Fifth District decided Howell v.\\nDunaway, 924 N.E.2d 1190 (Ill.App.2010). The Howell Court found that, in Bishop, the Supreme\\nCourt had expanded the common fund doctrine from its expression in Maynard, shifting the focus from\\nthe relationship between the parties to the “real question” of “whether the claimant had benefitted from', 'the lawsuit without contributing to its costs, thereby becoming unjustly enriched.” Id. at 1195. The\\nHowell Court pointed out that the relationship between a plaintiff and a hospital/lienholder is much\\nmore like a subrogor/subrogee relationship “than the court in Maynard recognized.” Id.. \\nWith all due respect to the Howell Court, the Supreme Court of Illinois has spoken, clearly and\\nunambiguously: the common fund doctrine does not apply to hospital liens. Moreover, I do not believe\\nthat the Supreme Court will adopt the reasoning used by the Fifth Circuit in Howell.  The “shift in\\nfocus” noted by the Howell Court is not nearly as pervasive as that Court would have it.  In Bishop,', 'the Supreme Court emphasized the centrality of the nature of the relationship between the parties,\\nemphasizing that  the quasi-contractual right to payment of fees was independent of and irrelevant to\\nthe contractual relationship between the health care plan and the beneficiary.   764 N.E.2d at 31. It was\\nonly in the context of those  relationships that the Court reached its decision that ERISA did not\\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 6 of 6                                             \\n      \\npreempt the common fund doctrine as it applies to attorney’s fees claims. Bishop demonstrates with', 'some force that the nature of the relationship between the parties remains crucial in deciding whether\\nthe common fund doctrine applies.  There is nothing in that opinion to suggest that a reconsideration\\nof Maynard is forthcoming.  \\n Other than the Howell challenge to the lien, Plaintiff has raised no other significant issue. I\\nconclude that Maynard applies, and under Maynard, the lien asserted by OSF is not subject to the\\ncommon fund doctrine.\\nThe OSF lien is therefore to be paid in full. The Petition by OSF is allowed. \\nENTERED ON July 13, 2010 \\ns/ John A. Gorman \\nJOHN A.

(Doc. 445).  Petitioner states that it holds a hospital lien \\npursuant to the Illinois Health Care Services Lien Act, 770 ILCS 23/1 et seq., \\nagainst a jury verdict and judgment obtained by Trish Lee McCloud in this Court.', '1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 448    Page 2 of 3                                             \\n      \\nMs. McCloud1 admits that her attorney did receive notice of the lien, but denies that \\nshe recovered the amount of the jury verdict.  Moreover, Ms. McCloud states that \\nPetitioner would be unjustly enriched if it collects the claimed amount of the lien \\nfrom her, because Petitioner already accepted Medicaid payment and a tax write-off \\nof the claimed expenses.  (Doc. 447).   \\n \\nOn August 24, 2007, a jury verdict in the amount of $15,000,000.14 was \\nentered in this case in favor of Ms. McCloud.  (Doc. 378).  A judgment for this', 'amount followed on August 30, 2007.  (Doc. 382).  However, Defendant Goodyear \\nDunlop Tires North America filed a Notice of Appeal on June 24, 2008.  (Doc. 422).  \\nDuring the appeal, the parties negotiated a settlement, and they moved the Court to \\napprove the settlement and requested the Court of Appeals to remand the case for \\nthat purpose.  (Doc. 432).  The Court subsequently vacated the August 30, 2007 \\njudgment, approved the terms of the confidential settlement2 after a fairness \\nhearing, and dismissed the case with prejudice.  (Doc. 436).                  \\n \\n \\nIn its Petition to Adjudicate Liens, Petitioner relies on the August 24, 2007', 'jury verdict.  As Ms. McCloud asserts, she did not recover payment on the jury \\nverdict, as the judgment arising from it was vacated.  Therefore, no lien can exist \\nagainst the jury verdict or the judgment arising from it.

For the following reasons, this Court holds that Illinois \\nLaw governs this case and Defendants Motion [Doc. 217] is \\nDENIED. \\n   \\n \\n  \\nI. \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\nThis case arises out of a motorcycle accident that occurred \\n \\non Interstate 55 in Livingston County, Illinois.  Plaintiff, \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 2 of 16', 'Trish McCloud was riding on the back of a motorcycle driven by \\nPlaintiff, William Booker.1  Together they were returning to \\nBaldwin, Michigan from a “blessing of the bikes” event in East \\nSaint Louis, Illinois.  (Doc. 224 at 8.)  \\n \\nThe motorcycle they were riding on was a 1985 Honda \\nGoldwing with tires that were manufactured by Goodyear Dunlop \\nTires of North America, Ltd. (“Dunlop”).  While traveling \\nNorthbound on Interstate 55, the rear tire of the motorcycle \\n“suddenly and catastrophically deflated.”  (Doc. 218 at 1.)  As \\na result of the accident, McCloud was permanently and severely \\ndisabled.   \\nPlaintiff alleges that the accident was caused by a', 'defectively manufactured rear tire.  Defendants, on the other \\nhand, argue that the reason for the blowout was that the tire \\nhad been run overloaded and underinflated for a long period of \\ntime.  \\nOn June 13, 2007, Defendants filed the Motion currently \\nbefore the Court in which they allege that Michigan law should \\napply to the facts of this case.  Plaintiff, in Response, argues \\nthat Illinois law should apply.  To that end, there are several \\nadditional facts which are integral to the matter at bar.  \\n                                                           \\n1 Since the briefs were filed related to this Order, Plaintiff \\nWilliam Booker has dismissed his claims against Defendants and', 'no longer is a party to this case.  \\n \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 3 of 16                                            \\n       \\nDefendants emphasize the following; Booker purchased the \\ntire and that it was installed at a store in Michigan; At the \\ntime of the accident, both Booker and McCloud were residents of \\nMichigan (Doc. 218 at 4-5.); And, according to Defendants, “the \\nevidence shows that Booker used the motorcycle with the subject \\ntire for two years, primarily in Michigan....” (Doc. 218 at 2.)  \\nHowever, Defendants do not provide any evidence which would \\nsupport their assertion that the motorcycle was primarily used \\nin Michigan.', 'Plaintiff, on the other hand, reiterates that the accident \\noccurred in Illinois and that she and Booker were traveling back \\nfrom East Saint Louis, Illinois.  In addition, McCloud states \\nthat St. Francis Medical Center, an Illinois non-profit \\ncorporation, has a lien for $261,902.32 against any recovery she \\nmight have in this action.  (Doc. 224 at 8.)  And finally, \\nPlaintiff points to evidence that shows that the subject tire \\nwas primarily used in Illinois.  Specifically, Plaintiff points \\nto Booker’s deposition testimony in which Booker discusses the \\nadditional trips that he made on the subject tire.  From there, \\nMcCloud puts together several computations from which she', 'concludes that 32 percent of the miles accumulated on the \\nsubject tire were accumulated in Illinois, 26 percent were in \\nMichigan, 19 percent were in Indiana, 8 percent were in Ohio, 6 \\npercent were in Kentucky, 5 percent were in Tennessee, and 4 \\n \\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 4 of 16                                            \\n       \\npercent were in Alabama.  Defendants do not raise any facts \\nchallenging this computational analysis in their Reply Brief \\n(Doc. 229).  As a result, this Court concludes that more miles \\nwere placed on the subject tire in Illinois than in any other \\nstate. \\nII. \\nANALYSIS \\n \\nFederal courts apply the choice of law rules of the state', 'where the matter was originally filed.  Klaxon Co. v. Stentor \\nElectric Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941).  The case at bar was \\nfiled in the Central District of Illinois, so Illinois’ choice \\nof law rules apply.   \\nIllinois follows the “most significant relationship” \\napproach.  Ingersoll v. Klein, 262 N.E.2d 593, 596 (Ill. 1970).  \\nThis approach is laid out in the Restatement (Second) of \\nConflict of Law § 145.  Under this approach there is a \\npresumption that the law of the state where the injury occurred \\nshould govern.  Ingersoll, 262 N.E.2d at 595.  That presumption \\ncan be overcome if there is another state that has a more \\nsignificant relationship to the occurrence or the parties.  To', 'determine which state has a more significant relationship, our \\nAppellate Court has paraphrased the two relevant sets of \\ncriteria as follows: \\n“The first set of criteria includes general \\nfactors such as the needs of the interstate system; \\n \\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 5 of 16                                            \\n       \\nrelevant policies of the forum and other interested \\nstates; protection of justified expectations; the \\nbasic policies underlying the particular field of law; \\ncertainty, predictability and uniformity of result; \\nand ease in the determination and application of the \\nlaw to be applied. The second set of criteria includes', 'the contacts to be taken into account in applying \\nthese principles. These contacts are: (1) the place of \\nthe injury; (2) the place of misconduct; (3) the \\ndomicile, residence, nationality, place of \\nincorporation and place of business of the parties; \\nand (4) the place where the relationship between the \\nparties is centered.” \\nIn re Air Crash Disaster Near Chicago, Illinois on May \\n25, 1979, 644 F.2d 594, 611-12 (7th Cir. 1981). \\n \\nFurthermore, our appellate court has ruled that the choice \\nof law determination for each relevant issue is severable.  \\nSpecifically, “[t]he application of choice-or-law rules is not a \\nmechanical process of cranking various factors through a', 'formula.  Critical to conflicts analysis is the notion that \\n[courts] must examine the choice-of-law rules not with regard to \\nvarious states’ interests in general, but precisely, with regard \\nto each state’s interest in the specific question [at bar].”  \\nId.  As a result, courts are to embrace the doctrine of depecage \\nin which a court separately considers which state’s law governs \\neach substantive issue.  If there are multiple issues which \\nwould be resolved differently under the law of two potentially \\ninterested jurisdictions, then a court must analyze these issues \\nseparately.  \\n  \\n \\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 6 of 16', 'In the case at bar, both sides agree that Illinois and \\nMichigan law have substantive differences regarding certain \\nissues relevant to this case. Illinois applies strict liability \\nto certain claims for manufacturing defects, See Blue v. \\nEnvironmental Engineering, Inc., 828 N.E.2d 1128 (2005), while \\nMichigan bases claims for manufacturing defects in negligence.  \\nPrentis v. Yale Mfg. Co., 421 Mich. 670 (Mich. 1984).  Illinois \\nrecognizes comparative negligence and bars recovery where the \\nplaintiff’s negligence is greater than fifty percent, 735 ILCS \\n5/2-1116, while Michigan has a system of pure comparative \\nnegligence so a plaintiff’s recovery is diminished by the', 'percentage of the plaintiff’s fault.  M.C.L. § 600.2959.  And, \\nMichigan has capped non-economic damages in product liability \\nactions at $500,000 in cases such as this.  M.C.L § 600.2946a.  \\n \\nThere is no dispute that there are certain facts in the \\ncase at bar which weigh heavily in favor of applying Illinois \\nlaw.  First, the accident occurred in Illinois.  As already \\nnoted, this alone creates a presumption that Illinois law \\napplies.  Secondly, under the Defendant’s theory of liability, \\nthe accident occurred because the subject tire was overloaded \\nand underinflated.  Since the tire was used in Illinois more \\n \\n6', '1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 7 of 16                                            \\n       \\nthan any other state, under the Defendant’s theory of liability, \\nthe injury causing conduct occurred primarily in Illinois.2  \\nFinally, on the trip in question, Plaintiff was returning \\nfrom her destination in Illinois.  This is relevant because \\nDefendants repeatedly argue that the injury “fortuitously” \\noccurred in Illinois because Plaintiff was simply passing \\nthrough the state. (Doc. 218 at 8, citing Schulze v. Illinois \\nHighway Transportation Co., 423 N.E.2d 278 (3rd Dist. 1981)).  In \\nparticular, Defendants repeatedly attempt to equate this case to', 'an airplane accident in which a plane fortuitously crashes in a \\nparticular state without any other connections to the situs of \\nthe crash.  (Doc. 218, citing In re Air Crash Disaster Near \\nRoselawn, Indiana on October 31, 1994, 926 F.Supp. 736, 742-43 \\n(N.D.Ill. 1996)(“Roselawn III”).  However, the facts do not \\nmirror the parallel that Defendants wish to draw.  At the time \\nof the accident, Plaintiff had specifically traveled to a \\nlocation in Illinois (the “blessing of the bikes” in East Saint \\nLouis, Illinois), and was on her return journey from East Saint \\nLouis, Illinois when the accident occurred.  It was not a random \\noccurrence that the accident happened in Illinois because the', 'majority of miles over the life of the bike were from roads \\n                                                           \\n2 Under the Plaintiff’s theory of liability the injury causing \\nconduct was the faulty manufacturing of the tire in New York.  \\nSince no party is arguing for application of New York law, this \\nfact does not weigh in either party’s favor and is not relevant \\nto the analysis for choosing between Illinois and Michigan law.  \\n \\n7\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 8 of 16                                            \\n       \\ntraveled in Illinois.  Furthermore, the majority of the trip in \\nquestion was spent in Illinois and the destination of the trip', 'was Illinois.  As a result, the fact that the accident occurred \\nin Illinois was not “fortuitous” but was instead a byproduct of \\nthe Plaintiff’s chosen journeys to and through Illinois.3  \\n \\nTogether, these facts create a strong presumption that \\nIllinois law should apply.  As a result, under the doctrine of \\ndepacage Defendant has the burden of pointing to the specific \\nareas of law where Michigan law should govern, and must put \\nforward strong policy considerations for applying Michigan law.  \\nIn the case at bar, Defendants put forward policy consideration \\nin the areas of 1) liability and 2) damages.4  For the following', '3 Defendants seem to semantically argue in favor of the word \\n“fortuitous” and state that “regardless of the fact that 32% of \\nthe tires total mileage accrued in Illinois, there was still a \\ngreater chance that the failure could have happened in the other \\nstates where the remaining 68% usage occurred.”  Defendants are \\ncorrect in that any time a random accident occurs in interstate \\ntravel its location is technically “fortuitous.”  However, in \\nthe case at bar, more miles were placed on the tire in Illinois \\nthan any other state.  And, Plaintiff was specifically on a trip \\nto Illinois.  As a result, based on the evidence before the', 'Court, the accident and resulting injuries were more likely to \\noccur in Illinois than any other state.  \\n  Defendants state that they wish for Michigan’s comparative \\nfault law to apply.  However, Defendants do not put forward any \\npolicy analysis in their initial brief (Doc. 218) which would \\nassist this Court in concluding that Michigan law should apply \\nto this issue.   \\n 4\\n \\n8\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 9 of 16                                            \\n       \\nreasons Defendants’ policy considerations do not overcome the \\npresumption that Illinois law applies.5  \\n1. Liability \\nDefendants argue that the relationship between the parties', 'was formed in Michigan.  Specifically, William Booker purchased \\nthe motorcycle tires in Michigan.  And, Trish McCloud chose to \\nbegin the journey in question on Booker’s motorcycle in \\nMichigan.  By getting on the motorcycle in Michigan she formed \\nher trust in the motorcycle and its wheels in Michigan.  \\nDefendants argue that because the relationship was formed \\nin Michigan, and because Plaintiff was a resident of Michigan at \\nthe time of the accident, policy concerns favor application of \\nMichigan liability law.   \\nIllinois has adopted the concept of strict liability in \\nproducts liability cases.  Garrison v. Heublein, Inc., 673 F.2d', '189 (7th Cir. 1982).  In a product liability case, to recover \\nunder strict liability, a Plaintiff must show that an injury \\nresulted from a condition of the product, the condition must be \\nunreasonably dangerous, and the condition must have existed at \\n                                                           \\n5 Plaintiff’s primary argument in response is that Defendants’ \\nhave not filed a timely request for an application of Michigan \\nlaw.   The Defendant’s choice of law determination is not \\nsubject to the Court’s dispositive motion deadline.  \\nFurthermore, Plaintiff does not point to any local rule or other \\nauthority which requires that a choice of law motion be filed by', \"a specific time.  Accordingly, the Court will not dispose of \\nDefendants’ request as untimely.  \\n \\n \\n9\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 10 of 16                                           \\n        \\nthe time the product left the manufacturer's control.  30A Ill. \\nLaw and Prac. Products Liability § 3.  \\nMichigan, on the other hand applies negligence law to \\nproducts liability claims.  In re Disaster at Detroit \\nMetropolitan Airport on August 16, 1987, 750 F.Supp. 793, 801 \\n(E.D.Mich. 1989).  According to Defendants, Michigan has adopted \\nthis policy to ensure that the public would not be “deprived of \\na product” absent a showing of fault.  Specifically, the\", 'negligence standard “incorporates greater intrinsic fairness in \\nthat the careful safety oriented manufacturer will not bear the \\nburden of paying for losses caused by the negligent product \\nseller....”  Prentis, 421 Mich. at 690.   \\nHowever, in the case at bar, Defendants have not argue that \\na “negligent product seller” caused the tire’s alleged defects.  \\n(Defendants Amended Answer – Doc. 36.)  Instead, they have \\nrepeatedly argued that the tire ruptured because Booker \\noverloaded and underinflated the subject tire.  Defendants can \\nstill make this argument because under Illinois law Plaintiff \\nmust show that the tire in question was defective ‘at the time', 'it left Defendants’ control.’  If Booker overloaded and \\nunderinflated the tire and this caused the tires’ relevant \\ndefects, then the defects did not exist when the tire left \\nDefendants’ control.  In such a case, Plaintiff would be lacking \\nan essential element to recover under Illinois’ strict liability \\n \\n10\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 11 of 16                                           \\n        \\nlaw.  As a result, the policy considerations regarding a \\nnegligent product seller put forward by Defendants (Doc. 218 at \\n12) do not apply in this case and certainly do not overcome the \\npresumption that Illinois law governs. \\n2. Damages', 'The laws regarding damages in Illinois and Michigan are \\nvastly different.  Michigan law caps non-economic damages at \\n$500,000 in cases such as this. Michigan Comp. Laws § 600.2946a \\n(2003).  Michigan also allows damages to be reduced because of \\ncollateral source payments.  Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.6303(a).  \\nAnd, Michigan requires a court to reduce both future economic \\nand non-economic damages to their present cash value.  Mich. \\nComp. Laws § 600.6306.  Illinois, on the other hand, does not \\nhave a cap on damages, does not allow for evidence of collateral \\nsource payments, and only requires a court to reduce future \\neconomic damages.', 'Defendants repeatedly emphasize that Plaintiff was an \\nIllinois resident at the time of the accident, and that the tire \\nwas sold in Michigan.  Accordingly, Defendants argue that \\nMichigan law should apply to the issue of damages. Defendants \\ncite Roselawn III, 926 F.Supp. at 746, which states that  \\n“[t]he choice of law of the plaintiff’s domicile \\nis the most sensible solution to conflicts concerning \\ncompensatory damages.  The reason is that the \\nplaintiff’s state has the most significant interest in \\nthe compensation of its domiciliaries.  It is \\n \\n11\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 12 of 16', 'inconceivable that a plaintiff’s state’s limits upon \\ncompensation can be said to constitute a desire to \\ngive its residents less than complete compensation.”6   \\n In response, Plaintiff focuses on the statutory cap on \\ndamages and points to a recent state appellate opinion.  \\nTownsend ex rel. Townsend v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 858 N.E.2d \\n552 (Ill. App. 1st 2006).  In Townsend, an Illinois Appellate \\nCourt ruled that a forum state has a compelling policy interest \\nin protecting against legislative encroachment into the \\njudiciaries’ right to determine damages.  The Illinois Supreme \\nCourt has previously ruled that a cap on damages violates the', 'separation of powers clause in Illinois’ Constitution because it \\ninfringed on the judiciary’s right to determine damages.  See \\nBest v. Taylor Machine Works, 689 N.E.2d 1057, 1081 (Ill. 1997).  \\nAccording to Townsend, there is a compelling state interest in \\nprotecting the rights of the judiciary, and this interest \\n                                                           \\n6 This Court disagrees with the reasoning of the Roselawn III \\nCourt.  When placing caps on product liability damages a state \\nlegislature balances the interest of completely compensating \\ntheir injured residents against the risk that they could be over \\ncompensated by overly sympathetic juries that lack appropriate', 'benchmarks for determining damages.  A resident of a state with \\nan overtly strict limit on damages could legitimately disagree \\nwith his own legislature and, if impassioned enough, choose to \\nvacation outside of his state and into a forum which placed a \\ngreater emphasis on product safety.  Or, a severely and \\npermanently injured resident of the overtly strict forum could \\nbelieve that his legislature has barred him from being complete \\ncompensation.  This is not to say that Michigan’s laws are \\nstrict.  Instead, it is simply to point out that it is quite \\n‘conceivable’ that a plaintiff could persuasively argue that his \\nown state’s limits on damages have left him less than', '‘completely compensated.’  \\n  \\n \\n12\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 13 of 16                                           \\n        \\noverrides any interest that the foreign state might have in \\ncapping non-economic damages.  Id. at 912-914.  As a result, a \\ncourt is required to consider that interest when making a choice \\nof law determination.  And, all other things being equal, \\nIllinois interest in keeping decisions on damages in the hands \\nof the judiciary overrides any interest that Michigan may have \\nin applying their cap.  \\n \\nAs long as Townsend is valid law in Illinois,7 Illinois law \\ngoverning caps on damages applies to this case.  Furthermore,', 'under the facts before the Court, even without Townsend, \\nIllinois law still governs the issue of damages. \\n \\nDefendants argue correctly that Michigan has an interest in \\nchoosing how well its residents are compensated for their \\ninjuries from defective products.  However, Illinois also has an \\ninterest in any damage award that Plaintiff may receive because \\nIllinois has an interest in making sure that tourists visiting \\n                                                           \\n7 Defendants point out that the Illinois Supreme Court has \\nrecently agreed to hear the appeal of Townsend.  Townsend v. \\nSears, Roebuck and Co., 865 N.E.2d 978 (table) (Ill. 2007).', 'However, unless and until the Illinois Supreme Court issues an \\nopinion reversing the decision of the Illinois Appellate Court, \\nthe current Townsend opinion provides the best available \\nguidance on how the Illinois Supreme Court would rule on this \\nissue.  See Adams v. Fred Weber, Inc., 849 F.2d 1018, 1026 (7th \\nCir. 1988); McGeshick v. Choucair, 9 F.3d 1229, 1232 (7th Cir. \\n1993)(noting that a federal court can only diverge from a \\ndecision of a state appellate court if a party has presented \\n“good reason” for diverging from the appellate court’s \\ndecision).  \\n \\n13\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 14 of 16', 'Illinois are adequately compensated for injuries that occur in \\nIllinois. \\nHere, it is important to emphasize that Plaintiff was not \\nsimply passing through Illinois, but was visiting Illinois.  \\nIllinois’ laws related to damages certainly do not favor the \\nproducers of products wishing to limit their liability.  \\nInstead, Illinois’ product liability laws allow for \\nmanufacturers to face higher damages and are thus further \\ndiscouraged from producing dangerous products.  For example, \\nIllinois law allows for greater liability because it does not \\nprovide a cap on damages, it does not allow for evidence of \\ncollateral source payments, and it only requires a court to', 'reduce future economic damages.  See Supra.  \\nIllinois has an interest in not only protecting its \\ncitizens but also its visitors from faulty products – even if \\nthat means providing greater damages (and greater protection) \\nthan a visitor might receive in his home state.  See Vlasic v. \\nWyndham, 451 F.Supp.2d 1005 (C.D.Ill. 2006)(ruling that Aruba \\nlaw applied to a tourist injured in Aruba and noting that Aruba \\nhas an interest in providing a safe environment for tourists).  \\nAnd, that policy interest is still advanced when a visitor is \\ninjured on a motorcycle that was purchased in a foreign state \\n \\n14', '1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 15 of 16                                           \\n        \\nbut was ridden into Illinois.8  After all, Illinois wants to \\nencourage motorcyclists to visit the state of Illinois, even if \\nthey are visiting on motorcycles that are purchased elsewhere.  \\nIllinois’ interest in protecting its tourists would not \\nalone be enough to apply Illinois law.  However, it undermines \\nDefendants’ policy argument that a plaintiff’s home state is the \\nonly jurisdiction that has an interest in compensating the \\nvictims of a product liability action.  As a result, Defendants’ \\npolicy considerations regarding damages are not robust enough to', 'overcome the fact that the injury occurred in Illinois, a \\nsubstantial part of the injury causing activity could likely \\nhave occurred in Illinois, and, as a visitor to Illinois, \\nPlaintiff has legitimate contacts with this state.  \\nIII.  \\nADDITIONAL ISSUES \\n \\nPlaintiff has filed a Motion for Leave to File a \\n \\nSupplemental Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion.  \\n[Doc. 230.]  Since the Court has ruled in Plaintiff’s Favor, the \\nrequest for additional briefing is MOOT. \\n \\nFurthermore, Defendants have filed a Motion to Reconsider \\n[Doc. 222] in which they request that this Court grant summary', '8 Defendants in this case cannot argue that they had no \\nreasonable expectation that they would ever be subjected to \\nIllinois law.

For the reasons that follow, Goodyear’s Motion for \\nSummary Judgment will be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 2 of 15                                            \\n       \\nI. \\nBackground \\nThe following facts are undisputed.  On or about May 26, \\n2002, driver William Booker (“Booker”) and passenger McCloud, \\nwere traveling on Booker’s 1985 Honda Goldwing motorcycle, going \\nnorthbound on Interstate 55 in Livingston County, Illinois, when \\nan allegedly defective rear tire “suddenly and catastrophically \\ndeflated,” resulting in personal injuries to both McCloud and', 'Booker.  As a result, on April 21, 2004, McCloud filed claims \\nfor strict liability and negligence against both Goodyear and \\nGoodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd. (“Dunlop”), alleging \\nthat the rear tire of the motorcycle -- which was a Dunlop \\nQualifier K6278150/90B15M/C74H DOT. No. DAWVM711200 -- was \\ndefective and unreasonably dangerous in design and manufacture.  \\nLikewise, on May 18, 2004, Booker also filed a complaint against \\nGoodyear and Dunlop alleging the same claims as McCloud.   \\nIn turn, Goodyear has filed the instant Motion for Summary \\nJudgment, alleging that it was not involved in the design, \\nmanufacture, assembly, advertising, selling, or distribution of', 'the subject tire in this case.  See [Doc. #154, pg. 5]. \\nII. \\nLegal Standard \\nSummary judgment should be granted where “the pleadings, \\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party \\n  \\n  \\n \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 3 of 15                                            \\n       \\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \\n56(c).  The moving party has the responsibility of informing the \\nCourt as to portions of the record that demonstrate the absence \\nof a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,', '477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  The movant may meet this burden by \\ndemonstrating “that there is an absence of evidence to support \\nthe nonmoving party’s case.”  Id. at 325.   \\n \\nOnce the movant has met its burden, to survive summary \\njudgment the “nonmovant must show through specific evidence that \\na triable issue of fact remains on issues on which [s]he bears \\nthe burden of proof at trial.”  Warsco v. Preferred Tech. Group, \\n258 F.3d 557, 563 (7th Cir. 2001); see also Celotex Corp., 477 \\nU.S. at 322-24.  “The nonmovant may not rest upon mere \\nallegations in the pleadings or upon conclusory statements in \\naffidavits; it must go beyond the pleadings and support its', 'contentions with proper documentary evidence.”  Chemsource, Inc. \\nv. Hub Group, Inc., 106 F.3d 1358, 1361 (7th Cir. 1997). \\n \\nThis Court must nonetheless “view the record and all \\ninferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the \\n[non-moving party].”  Holland v. Jefferson Nat. Life Ins. Co., \\n883 F.2d 1307, 1312 (7th Cir. 1989).  In doing so, this Court is \\nnot “required to draw every conceivable inference from the \\nrecord -- only those inferences that are reasonable.”  Bank \\nLeumi Le-Isreal, B.M. v. Lee, 928 F.2nd 232, 236 (7th Cir. \\n1991).  Therefore, if the record before the court “could not \\n \\n3', '1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 4 of 15                                            \\n       \\nlead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party,” \\nthen no genuine issue of material fact exists and, the moving \\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  McClendon v. \\nIndiana Sugars, Inc., 108 F.3d 789, 796 (7th Cir. 1997) (quoting \\nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, \\n587 (1986)).  However, in ruling on a motion for summary \\njudgment, the court may not weigh the evidence or resolve issues \\nof fact; disputed facts must be left for resolution at trial.  \\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986).   \\nIII. \\nAnalysis', 'The Court first points out the there is a dispute between \\nthe parties as to which legal theory should apply in assessing \\nGoodyear’s liability in the underlying action.  McCloud argues \\nthat Goodyear should be liable for any defects regarding the \\ntire in question, because Goodyear held itself out to the public \\nand its investors as controlling the manufacturing processes and \\nsales at the Tonawanda plant in New York -- where the subject \\ntire was manufactured.  See Aebischer v. Stryker Corp., No. 05-\\n2121, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1619; 2006 WL 44307 (C.D. Ill. Jan. \\n9, 2006) (applying the “holding out theory”).  Goodyear, on the', 'other hand, argues that Aebischer does not apply to the instant \\nmatter but, instead, the Van Dorn test should apply because \\nMcCloud is attempting to pierce the corporate veil. \\n  \\n \\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 5 of 15                                            \\n       \\nA review of McCloud’s complaint against Goodyear reveals a \\n \\nfactual basis to analyze Goodyear’s liability under both the \\n“holding out” theory and the Van Dorn test.  In her Complaint, \\nMcCloud asserts both strict liability and negligence theories of \\nrecovery against Goodyear.  Both theories of recovery, however, \\nhave different applicable legal standards.  See Bittler v. White', 'and Co., Inc., 560 N.E.2d 979, 982 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990). \\n \\nIn cases where a plaintiff attempts to hold a parent \\ncompany liable for the acts of its subsidiary under a negligence \\ntheory, the plaintiff must establish that either one corporation \\nwas the mere instrumentality of the other, or that one \\ncorporation was simply a dummy or sham and that failing to \\nimpose liability would justify a wrong or perpetuate a fraud.  \\nSee Main Bank of Chicago v. Baker, 427 N.E.2d 94, 101 (Ill. \\n1981).  This standard was later named the “Van Dorn” test, after \\nthe Seventh Circuit adopted this approach in Van Dorn Co. v \\nFuture Chemical & Oil Co., 753 F.2d 565 (7th Cir. 1985).  In', 'Baker, the Illinois Supreme Court explained that: \\n[B]efore the separate corporate identity of one \\ncorporation will be disregarded and treated as the \\nalter ego of another, it must be shown that it is so \\ncontrolled and its affairs so conducted that it is a \\nmere instrumentality of another, and it must further \\nappear that observance of the fiction of separate \\nexistence would, under the circumstances, sanction a \\nfraud or promote injustice. Id. at 101. \\nIn support of their contention that the Van Dorn test \\nshould not apply, McCloud relies on Chief District Judge Michael \\n \\n \\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 6 of 15', 'P. McCuskey’s recent decision in Aebischer v. Stryker Corp., No. \\n05-2121, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1619 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 9, 2006).  \\nAebischer came before the Court on a Motion to Amend the \\nComplaint in which the Plaintiff sought to file an amended \\ncomplaint which alleged that a Defendant held itself out as the \\nmanufacturer of an allegedly defective replacement hip, a \\ntypical product liability claim.  The Court noted that a party \\nholding itself out formed a basis for product liability claims \\n(as discussed below) and allowed the filing of the Amended \\nComplaint, denied Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment and \\nallowed further discovery.  See, Aebischer v. Stryker Corp. 2006', 'WL 2038545 (C.D.Ill. Jul 19 2006) (considering a later motion to \\ncompel).  The Court did not perform any analysis regarding the \\nnegligence claim. Furthermore, the Court did not hold that the \\nVan Dorn test was not the correct measure for whether a \\nplaintiff should be able to pierce the corporate veil of a \\nparent corporation in a negligence claim. Therefore, Aebischer \\nis distinguishable with regard to Plaintiff’s negligence claim. \\n \\nSince one of McCloud’s claims seeks to impose negligent \\nliability upon Goodyear as a parent corporation for negligence \\ncommitted by, the subsidiary - Dunlop, the Van Dorn test applies \\nto McCloud’s negligence claims.  However, in regard to McCloud’s', 'strict liability claims, the “holding out” theory is the correct \\nstandard to be applied.  See Connelly v. Uniroyal, Inc., 389 \\nN.E.2d 155 (Ill. 1979); see Also, Hebel v. Sherman Equipment, \\n \\n6\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 7 of 15                                            \\n       \\n442 N.E.2d 199 (Ill. 1982).  In all the Illinois cases in which \\na court has applied the “holding out” theory, the plaintiff was \\nproceeding against the defendant based on a products \\nliability/strict liability claim.  See Ogg v. City of \\nSpringfield, 458 N.E.2d 1331 (Ill. App. Ct. 1984); see also, \\nRoot v. JH Industries, Inc., 660 N.E.2d 195 (Ill. App. Ct.', '1995); Hebel, 442 N.E.2d 199; Connelly, 370 N.E.2d 1189.  \\nAccordingly, the Court will first address Goodyear’s liability \\nas to Plaintiffs’ negligence claim under the Van Dorn test, and \\nthen Goodyear’s liability as to McCloud’s strict liability \\nclaims under the “holding out” theory. \\nA.  The “Van Dorn” Test \\n \\nIn cases where a plaintiff has attempted to hold a parent \\ncompany liable for the acts of its subsidiary for negligence, \\ncourts have repeatedly applied the Van Dorn test.  See Connelly, \\n370 N.E.2d at 1196;  Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Pepper Source, \\n941 F.2d 519 (7th Cir. 1991); Torco Oil Co. v. Innovative \\nThermal Corp., 763 F.Supp. 1445 (N.D.Ill. 1991); See also, Van', 'Dorn, 753 F.2d at 569, 570.  In Van Dorn, the Seventh Circuit \\nheld that generally: \\n  “[u]nder Illinois law, a corporation is a legal \\nentity separate and distinct from its shareholders, \\ndirectors and officers, and, generally, from other \\ncorporations with which it may be affiliated.  \\nHowever, a corporate entity will be disregarded and \\nthe veil of limited liability pierced when two \\nrequirements are met: First, there must be such unity \\nof interest and ownership that the separate \\npersonalities of the corporation and the individual \\n \\n7\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 8 of 15                                            \\n       \\n[or other corporation] no longer exist; and second,', 'circumstances must be such that adherence to the \\nfiction of a separate corporate existence would \\nsanction a fraud or promote injustice.”   \\n \\nId. at 569, 570 (citations omitted). \\n \\n1.  Unity of Interest \\n \\n“Stock control and the existence of common officers and \\ndirectors are generally prerequisites to the piercing of the \\ncorporate veil although these factors alone will not suffice.”  \\nHystro Products, Inc. v. MNP Corp., 18 F.3d 1384, 1389 (7th Cir. \\n1994)(citations omitted).  This is because, “[t]heoretically, \\nevery parent corporation, by virtue of its ownership interest, \\nhas the power, right, and ability to control the products of its', 'subsidiary.”  Bunch v. Centeon, L.L.C., No. 99-C3511, 2000 U.S. \\nDist. LEXIS 17144, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 24, 2000).  Therefore, \\n“to hold a parent company liable for acts by a subsidiary, the \\nlegal separateness of the parent and subsidiary must have been \\ndisregarded in a wide range of matters.”  Bunch, 2000 U.S. Dist. \\nLEXIS 17144, at *6.   \\n \\nIn determining whether the requisite degree of control is \\nmaintained by one corporation over the affairs of another to \\njustify disregarding their separate corporate identities, the \\nIllinois courts have considered some of the following factors: \\n“(1) the failure to maintain adequate corporate records or to', 'comply with corporate formalities, (2) the commingling of funds \\nor assets, (3) undercapitalization, and (4) one corporation \\n \\n8\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 9 of 15                                            \\n       \\ntreating the assets of another corporation as its own.”  Van \\nDorn, 753 F.2d at 570.  Some more factors that have also been \\nconsidered include: Who controlled the day-to-day operations, \\nmanufacturing and design processes, did the two corporations \\nshare the same employees, who controlled payroll, and, did the \\ntwo corporations have separate facilities?  Id. at 572; See \\nalso, Hystro Products, Inc., 18 F.3d at 1389.', 'In considering the first four factors as applied to the \\ncase at hand, it is unclear from the record whether Dunlop \\nfailed to maintain adequate corporate records or comply with \\ncorporate formalities, or that Dunlop was even undercapitalized.  \\nThe record, however, does indicate that Goodyear reported \\nDunlop’s profits and assets as their own.  In regards to the \\nother considerations, Plaintiffs’ allege that the policies and \\nprocedures for the operation of Dunlop’s business, including \\nproduct quality and safety of the tires it manufactures, have \\nbeen controlled by Goodyear since 1999.  However, the record to \\nwhich Plaintiffs’ cite to in support of this contention is', 'merely a business conduct manual, and does not in any way \\nindicate whether Goodyear controls the day-to-day operations, \\nmanufacturing, and design processes of Dunlop.  Goodyear’s \\nfinancial report only indicates that after they acquired 75% of \\nDunlop’s interest, that in order to maximize market growth \\nopportunities, they effected a plan that included the downsizing \\nor consolidation of manufacturing, sales, support and \\n \\n9\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 10 of 15                                           \\n        \\ndistribution operations.  This definitely suggests that Goodyear \\ncontrolled the marketing processes, however, there is nothing', 'else in the record that indicates whether they specifically \\ncontrolled the manufacturing and design processes at Dunlop’s \\nTonawanda Plant on a day-to-day basis.  Goodyear’s website \\nmerely indicates that Dunlop’s Tonawanda plant is a part of the \\nGoodyear family of companies which does not suggest that they \\ncontrolled Dunlop’s Tonawanda plant’s manufacturing, operation, \\nand design processes. \\n \\nGoodyear and Dunlop did not share the same employees, and \\nDunlop even had their own headquarters located in West Amherst, \\nNew York.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that \\nGoodyear has made a warranty of any kind to any person with', 'respect to the specific tire in question, or even to motorcycle \\ntires period.  In fact, Dunlop manufactured the tire in question \\nin their Tonawanda plant, which meant that Goodyear neither \\nmanufactured nor was in possession of the tire in question at \\nany time.  Accordingly, the Court must find, with respect to \\nPlaintiffs’ \\nnegligence \\nclaims, \\nthat \\ndespite \\nGoodyear’s \\nsubstantial ownership of Dunlop’s stock, these two corporations \\nhave always operated as separate entities and continue to do so \\ntoday.  Therefore, the Court finds no basis on which to find \\nthat there is unity of interest and ownership that the separate \\npersonalities of Goodyear and Dunlop should be disregarded.', '2.  Fraud or the Promotion of an Injustice \\n \\n10\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 11 of 15                                           \\n        \\nEven if the Court finds Goodyear to have sufficient control \\n \\nover Dunlop, to hold them liable for the negligent acts of \\nDunlop, the Plaintiffs have still not offered any proof of fraud \\nor that an injustice will result if they are not allowed to also \\nhold Goodyear liable.  The Van Dorn court held that, “[o]nce the \\nfirst element of the test is established, either the sanctioning \\nof a fraud (intentional wrongdoing) or the promotion of \\ninjustice, will satisfy the second element.  Van Dorn, 753 F.2d', 'at 570.  In order to satisfy the second requirement, Plaintiffs’ \\nmust establish more than the inability to collect on their \\njudgment.  Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Pepper Source, 993 F.2d 1309, \\n1311 (7th Cir. 1993).  Plaintiffs’ must establish a “wrong” such \\nas where: \\n“the common sense rules of adverse possession would be \\nundermined; former partners would be permitted to \\nskirt the legal rules concerning monetary obligations; \\na party would be unjustly enriched; a parent \\ncorporation that caused a sub’s liabilities and its \\ninability to pay for them would escape those \\nliabilities; or an intentional scheme to squirrel \\nassets into a liability-free corporation while heaping', 'liabilities upon an asset-free corporation would be \\nsuccessful.” \\n \\nId. at 1311, 1312 (quoting Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Pepper \\nSource, 941 F.2d 519, 524 (7th Cir. 1991)). \\n \\nIn the present case, Plaintiff, McCloud conceded that she \\nwas not able to find any evidence that would show, “that \\nadherence to the fiction of separate corporate existence,” in \\nthis case, “would sanction a fraud or promote injustice.” \\n \\n11\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 12 of 15                                           \\n        \\nCiting, Van Dorn, 753 F.2d at 569-70.  And since Plaintiff, \\nBooker, failed to respond to this Court’s order requesting', 'evidence to satisfy the second prong of the Van Dorn test, this \\nCourt concludes that Plaintiffs’ have failed to provide evidence \\nfrom which a reasonable jury could conclude that the second \\nprong of the Van Dorn test has been satisfied.  Accordingly, the \\nCourt grants Goodyear’s motion for summary judgment in part, as \\nit relates to Plaintiffs’ negligence claims against Goodyear. \\nB.  “Holding Out” Theory \\n \\nUnder Illinois law, “the law is clear that a company which \\nholds itself out to the public as the manufacturer of a product \\nis liable for the injuries caused by that product if it is found \\nto be unreasonably dangerous.”  Ogg, 458 N.E.2d at 1336', '(citations omitted).  In the past, the aim of the “holding out” \\ntheory or “apparent manufacturer” doctrine, was to provide a \\nremedy for consumers injured by unsafe products.  Hebel, 442 \\nN.E.2d at 202.  This same objective is now “achieved by the \\ndoctrine of strict products liability.”  Id.  In other words, \\n“[t]he function of the apparent-manufacturer doctrine has, as it \\nwere, been absorbed by the theory of sellers’ strict liability \\nin tort for injuries caused by unreasonably unsafe products.”  \\nId.  The Supreme Court of Illinois has held that: \\n“The primary rationale for imposing liability on the \\napparent manufacturer of a defective product is that', 'it has induced the purchasing public to believe that \\nit is the actual manufacturer, and to act on this \\nbelief-that is, to purchase the product in reliance on \\n \\n12\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 13 of 15                                           \\n        \\nthe apparent manufacturer’s reputation and skill in \\nmaking it.” \\n \\nId. at 203 (emphasis included). \\nTherefore, “whether a holding out has occurred must be \\njudged from the viewpoint of the purchasing public, and in light \\nof circumstances as of the time of purchase.”  Id.  Another \\nrationale which justifies imposing strict liability on \\nmanufacturers, “is based on the fact that [the manufacturers],', 'as part of the chain of distribution, are involved in and reap a \\nprofit from the placement of the allegedly defective product \\ninto the stream of commerce.”  Bittler, 560 N.E.2d at 981 \\n(citing Hebel, 442 N.E.2d 199).  Furthermore,  \\n“[e]ven parties who are not within the actual chain of \\ndistribution, but who play an integral role in the \\nmarketing enterprise of an allegedly defective product \\nand participate in the profits derived from placing \\nthe product into the stream of commerce, are held \\nliable under the doctrine of strict liability.” \\n \\nId. (citing Connelly, 389 N.E.2d 155). \\nIn the present case, the record definitely shows that', 'Goodyear reports Dunlop’s profits as their own, thereby \\nsupporting the notion that Goodyear reaps the profits from the \\ntires that Dunlop manufacturers and sells.  Whether Goodyear \\nprofits from Dunlop’s manufacture of motorcycle tires–-\\nspecifically, the tire in question–-is, however, disputable.  \\nThomas Johnson, Jr., the tire performance manager at Dunlop in \\n2005, stated that he “believed” the motorcycle operations at \\n  \\n  \\n \\n13\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 14 of 15                                           \\n        \\nDunlop were a separate entity from Goodyear’s purchase of \\nDunlop.   \\nHowever, a belief is not the same as actual knowledge, and', 'there is nothing in the record that either proves or disproves \\nhis statement.  It is disputable whether Goodyear plays an \\nintegral role in the marketing of the allegedly defective tire.  \\nGoodyear took over the marketing of Dunlop, which includes the \\nsale of Dunlop products.  However, there is nothing in the \\nrecord to indicate whether Goodyear also took over the \\nmotorcycle division of Dunlop.  The record only states that \\nGoodyear acquired 75% of Dunlop’s interest, and with it, \\nDunlop’s tire sales and distribution operations.  The record \\ndoes not indicate which tire sales or distribution operations.   \\n \\nSummary judgment should be granted “where the pleadings,', 'depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, \\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine \\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is \\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed.

Defendants failed to respond to\\nBooker’s Motion and, on September 23, 2005, this Court held that\\nthere was no genuine issue as to any material fact in dispute and,\\nthat Booker’s settlement with McCloud was fair, reasonable and “in\\ngood faith” within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Contribution\\nAct.  740 ILCS 100/2(c).  Accordingly, summary judgment was granted\\nin favor of Booker.\\nBooker has now filed the instant Motion requesting the Court\\nto enter a partial final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the\\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  And, again, Defendants have\\nfailed to respond.\\nRule 54(b) permits a court to enter a partial final judgment', '“when a distinct claim has been fully resolved with respect to all\\nparties[,]” and there is no just reason for delay.

Reduction of Claim to Amount That Would Be Paid by Insurance \\nRespondent’s first argument is that Petitioner’s Lien should have been \\nreduced to the amount that Petitioner would have received in reimbursement had \\nthey billed the services to either public or private insurance.

That motorcycle accident is the subject of this\\nlitigation. The billed amount for those goods and services was $261,902.33. When this lawsuit was\\nfiled, OSF served a lien against the injury claim for that amount. \\nTrish McCloud’s claim was tried to a jury, which rendered a Verdict in her favor, awarding\\ndamages in the amount of $15,000,000.14. That Verdict was itemized; the amount awarded for\\npayment of past medical care, treatment, services and life care needs was $472,794.14. (See Verdict,\\nDoc. #378). That amount, which included the OSF bills, was presented by the Plaintiff as part of', 'stipulated medical expenses, the reasonableness of which was undisputed at trial.\\nThe Verdict was appealed, and on appeal the parties participated in the Seventh Circuit’s\\nsettlement process. The case was settled for a confidential amount. The settlement was approved by\\nthe Court on December 10, 2008. The approval included attorney’s fees of 40% of the settlement\\namount plus expenses, which totaled $551,811.73.\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 2 of 6                                             \\n      \\nAfter the settlement fund was established and paid, Plaintiff’s lawyers and OSF lawyers began', 'adverse parties, the circuit court shall adjudicate the rights of all interested parties and enforce\\ntheir liens. \\nUnder this Act, so long as the total amount of liens is less than 40% of the verdict or\\nsettlement, the lien is enforceable. 770 ILCS 23/10(c). There is no dispute between Plaintiff and OSF\\nthat the amount of liens is less than 40% of the settlement. What is not clear, however, is whether the\\nlien is subject to the common fund doctrine. \\nThe question whether the common fund doctrine applies to liens of medical providers was\\nmentioned in Baier v. State Farm Ins. Co., 361 N.E.2d 1100 (Ill.1977). In that case, the plaintiff was', 'an attorney who had represented a plaintiff in an automobile accident case.

To obtain that amount, his client\\n1In an Order entered earlier in this case (See Order, Doc. #469), a motion to compel was\\ndenied. In that Order, the Court found specifically that Plaintiff would not be allowed to challenge\\nthe jury’s finding that Plaintiff’s medical bills, including those from OSF, were reasonable and\\ncustomary, either directly or indirectly. Plaintiff’s indirect challenges were based on what an\\ninsured patient would have paid and what Medicaid would have paid. In the briefing regarding', 'Defendant’s insurer issued a draft for $11,027.96 to the Plaintiff, his wife, his attorney and the\\nhospital. The hospital then filed its petition to adjudicate the rights of the parties to that amount. The\\ntrial court ordered that the hospital pay from the total amount one-third of the costs incurred ($205.48)\\nand one-third of the total for attorney’s fees. The hospital appealed, and the appellate court reversed.\\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 4 of 6                                             \\n      \\nBefore the Supreme Court, the plaintiff argued that the trial court had properly applied the\\ncommon fund doctrine. The Supreme Court rejected that argument, finding two “important', 'some force that the nature of the relationship between the parties remains crucial in deciding whether\\nthe common fund doctrine applies.  There is nothing in that opinion to suggest that a reconsideration\\nof Maynard is forthcoming.  \\n Other than the Howell challenge to the lien, Plaintiff has raised no other significant issue. I\\nconclude that Maynard applies, and under Maynard, the lien asserted by OSF is not subject to the\\ncommon fund doctrine.\\nThe OSF lien is therefore to be paid in full.

At the \\nfinal pretrial conference this Court ordered expedited briefing \\non this issue and Granted Defendants leave to file a Reply \\nBrief.

For the following reasons, this Court holds that Illinois \\nLaw governs this case and Defendants Motion [Doc. 217] is \\nDENIED. \\n   \\n \\n  \\nI. \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\nThis case arises out of a motorcycle accident that occurred \\n \\non Interstate 55 in Livingston County, Illinois.  Plaintiff, \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 2 of 16', 'defectively manufactured rear tire.  Defendants, on the other \\nhand, argue that the reason for the blowout was that the tire \\nhad been run overloaded and underinflated for a long period of \\ntime.  \\nOn June 13, 2007, Defendants filed the Motion currently \\nbefore the Court in which they allege that Michigan law should \\napply to the facts of this case.  Plaintiff, in Response, argues \\nthat Illinois law should apply.  To that end, there are several \\nadditional facts which are integral to the matter at bar.  \\n                                                           \\n1 Since the briefs were filed related to this Order, Plaintiff \\nWilliam Booker has dismissed his claims against Defendants and', 'inconceivable that a plaintiff’s state’s limits upon \\ncompensation can be said to constitute a desire to \\ngive its residents less than complete compensation.”6   \\n In response, Plaintiff focuses on the statutory cap on \\ndamages and points to a recent state appellate opinion.  \\nTownsend ex rel. Townsend v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 858 N.E.2d \\n552 (Ill. App. 1st 2006).  In Townsend, an Illinois Appellate \\nCourt ruled that a forum state has a compelling policy interest \\nin protecting against legislative encroachment into the \\njudiciaries’ right to determine damages.  The Illinois Supreme \\nCourt has previously ruled that a cap on damages violates the', 'and Rubber Company [Doc. 240].  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion \\nto Reconsider is MOOT.  \\nIV.  \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion for a \\nChoice of Law Determination [Doc. 217] is DENIED.

It is granted to the \\nextent that the Court herein reconsiders portions of Magistrate Judge Gorman’s \\nOrder, however all of its objections are DENIED.  Magistrate Judge Gorman’s \\nOrder is AFFIRMED, and Petitioner’s Lien is to be paid in full. \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\nThe underlying litigation in this matter began in 2004, when Respondent \\nTrish Lee McCloud filed suit against Goodyear Dunlop Tires for injuries she \\nsustained in a motorcycle accident.  (Doc. 1).  Respondent’s claim was tried to a jury, \\nand the jury rendered a verdict in her favor, awarding her damages in the amount \\nof $15,000,000.14.  (Doc. 378 at 2).  Of this total award, $472,794.14 was for the \\n“reasonable value of necessary medical care, treatment, services and life care needs \\nof [Respondent] to the present time.”  (Doc. 378 at 1).  The verdict was appealed \\n(Doc. 422) and the parties reached a settlement, which was approved by this Court \\non December 10, 2008 (Doc. 436).   \\n \\nFollowing the settlement of the case, Petitioner, OSF Healthcare System \\nd/b/a Saint Francis Medical Center (“OSF”), filed a Petition to Adjudicate a Lien \\npursuant to the Health Care Services Lien Act, 770 ILCS 23/1 et. seq., seeking to \\nrecover the $261,902.33 that it had billed to Respondent for medical goods and \\nservices provided to her after her motorcycle accident.  (Doc. 445). After ordering \\nfuller briefing addressing the merits of the Petition (Doc. 448), as well as the Court’s \\njurisdiction over it (Text Order of 12/18/09), the Court determined that it had  \\nancillary jurisdiction over the Petition pursuant to the settlement agreement, and \\n \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 3 of 9                                             \\n      \\nreferred the matter to Magistrate Judge Gorman for further post-judgment \\nproceedings related thereto.  (Doc. 454 at 3-4).   \\n \\nSubsequently, Magistrate Judge Gorman presided over all matters relating \\nto the Petition to Adjudicate Liens, including allowing the withdrawal of \\nPetitioner’s Motion for Sanctions (Text Order of 3/4/2010), denying a Motion to \\nCompel Discovery filed by Respondent (Doc. 469), and ordering that Petitioner’s lien \\nbe paid in full (Doc. 478).  It is this final order, which adjudicated Petitioner’s lien \\nand determined that it should be paid in full, to which Respondent now objects.  \\n(Doc. 479).  Respondent argues that Magistrate Judge Gorman did not have \\njurisdiction to enter such an order, and that the order is erroneous and contrary to \\nlaw.   \\nI. Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Jurisdiction \\n \\nSection 636 of Title 28 of the United States Code sets forth the jurisdiction of \\na United States Magistrate Judge.  According to that statute, a magistrate judge \\nhas jurisdiction to hear and determine various pretrial matters of a non-dispositive \\nnature upon designation by the district judge.  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A).  Further, \\nupon the consent of the parties, a magistrate judge may conduct any or all \\nproceedings in a nonjury civil matter and order entry of judgment in the case, when \\nspecially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court.  § 636(c)(1).  \\nConsent under § 636(c)(1) may be either express or inferred from the parties’ \\nconduct during litigation.  Roell v. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580 (2003).  Where a litigant \\nis “made aware of the need for consent and the right to refuse it, and still \\nvoluntarily appear[s] to try the case before the Magistrate Judge” consent is \\n \\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 4 of 9                                             \\n      \\nproperly inferred, and the Magistrate Judge has jurisdiction.  Id. at 590.  Finally, “a \\nmagistrate judge may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent \\nwith the Constitution and laws of the United States.” § 636(b)(3).  \\n   \\nRespondent argues that Magistrate Judge Gorman did not have jurisdiction \\nto enter judgment on the Petition to Adjudicate Liens under § 636(c).  Specifically, \\nRespondent states that there was never any indication that the Petition was \\nreferred to Magistrate Judge Gorman for the purposes of entering judgment, and \\nthat therefore Respondent did not consent to his doing so.  (Doc. 479 at 2-3).  \\nTherefore, Respondent argues that the Court should treat Magistrate Judge \\nGorman’s order as a proposed finding and recommendation pursuant to § \\n636(b)(1)(B), and engage in a de novo review of the portions of his order to which \\nRespondent now objects.  (Doc. 479 at 3).   \\n \\nPetitioner responds that Magistrate Judge Gorman did, in fact, have \\njurisdiction over their Petition to Adjudicate Liens pursuant to § 636(c)(1), and that \\ntherefore his order must be treated as the final judgment of this Court.  (Doc. 480 at \\n2).  According to Petitioner, the parties impliedly consented to Magistrate Judge \\nGorman’s jurisdiction pursuant to § 636(c)(1) due to the fact that they voluntarily \\nproceeded before him on numerous occasions after this Court referred the matter to \\nhim in its Order and Opinion of January 14, 2010.  (Doc. 480 at 2-3).  Because \\nRespondent never objected to Magistrate Gorman’s jurisdiction prior to his final \\norder adjudicating the lien, Petitioner maintains that the parties consented to his \\njurisdiction, and cannot now complain simply because his final decision was adverse \\nto them.  (Doc. 480 at 2). \\n \\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 5 of 9                                             \\n      \\n \\nThe Court is confused over this dispute as Magistrate Judge Gorman never \\nentered any judgment, but instead issued an Order on Petitioner’s Petition to \\nAdjudicate Liens, as was referred to him by this Court.  This is undoubtedly not a \\ncase to which the parties consented pursuant to §636(c)(1), as the parties were \\nnever made aware of the need to formally consent to the Magistrate Judge’s \\njurisdiction; nor did they ever expressly do so.  Instead, because the power to \\nadjudicate liens is not expressly granted in either the federal statute or this Court’s \\nLocal Rules, the Court finds that the case was properly referred to Magistrate \\nJudge Gorman pursuant to § 636(b)(3), the catch-all provision of the Federal \\nMagistrates Act, which allows for the referral of any matter which is not \\ninconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.    \\n \\nBecause the adjudication of Petitioner’s lien was dispositive of Petitioner’s \\nclaim, it is appropriate to adopt the standard of review for dispositive pretrial \\nmatters: a de novo review upon the record.  Talbott v. Empress River Casino, 1997 \\nWL 458537, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 4, 1997).  “A de novo review does not require a new \\nhearing, but the Court must give fresh consideration to those issues to which \\nspecific objections have been made.”  Id. (internal quotations omitted).  Accordingly, \\nthe Court will take a fresh look at the portions of Judge Gorman’s Order to which \\nRespondent has now objected.     \\nII. Objections to Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Order \\n \\nThe first objection Respondent makes to Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Order of \\nJuly 13, 2010 (Doc. 478) is that he found that the Illinois “common fund doctrine” \\ndid not apply to hospital liens.  In making this determination, Magistrate Judge \\n \\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 6 of 9                                             \\n      \\nGorman disregarded an Illinois Court of Appeals for the Fifth District decision, \\nHowell v. Dunaway, 924 N.E.2d 1190 (Ill. App. 2010), which diverged from previous \\nIllinois law and held that the doctrine did, in fact, apply to hospital liens such as \\nthose asserted by Petitioner.  However, since the time Respondent filed her \\nobjections, the Illinois Supreme Court has issued an opinion reversing the Fifth \\nDistrict’s opinion, and explicitly holding that, in Illinois, the common fund doctrine \\nis not applicable to health care liens under the Health Care Services Lien Act.  \\nWendling v. Southern Ill. Hosp. Svcs., ---N.E.2d ---, 2011 WL 1085186 (Ill. March 24, \\n2011).  Accordingly, Magistrate Judge Gorman’s prediction of Illinois law was fully \\ncorrect and Respondent’s first objection to his Order of July 13, 2010 (Doc. 478) \\nfails.1    \\n \\nIn addition, Respondent argues that she raised three other claims before \\nMagistrate Judge Gorman, which he rejected without articulating his reasons for \\ndoing so.  These claims include:  1) Petitioner’s claim should be reduced because its \\ncharges for Ms. McCloud’s treatment were substantially higher than Petitioner \\nwould have received for the same services provided to an insured patient, or if it \\nhad timely sought reimbursement for all of its charges from Michigan Medicaid, \\nbecause otherwise Petitioner would be unjustly enriched to the detriment of \\nRespondent; 2) Petitioner’s lien claim should be denied because Petitioner has not \\n                                                           \\n1Respondent concedes that her objection to Magistrate Judge Gorman’s \\ndetermination regarding applicability of the common fund doctrine to health care \\nliens would fail if the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the Fifth District’s decision in \\nHowell. (Doc. 479 at 6).  Specifically, Respondent invited the Court to “defer final \\nadjudication of the lien pending a decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in the \\nHowell case, at which point, any uncertainty regarding the state of Illinois law on \\nthis subject will be resolved.”  (Doc. 479 at 6).   \\n \\n6\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 7 of 9                                             \\n      \\nsatisfied its burden that the amount of the lien is reasonable and because \\nRespondent was denied an opportunity to make discovery on that issue; and 3) \\nPetitioner’s acceptance of Medicaid reimbursement for a portion of its charges bars \\nits current claim for reimbursement from Respondent.  (Doc. 479 at 4-5).  Although \\nRespondent makes no arguments in support of these claims in its current \\nObjections, because the Court is performing a de novo review on the record, it will \\nlook to the parties’ briefs before Magistrate Judge Gorman in order to determine \\nwhether Respondent’s claims are with or without merit.   \\nA. Reduction of Claim to Amount That Would Be Paid by Insurance \\nRespondent’s first argument is that Petitioner’s Lien should have been \\nreduced to the amount that Petitioner would have received in reimbursement had \\nthey billed the services to either public or private insurance.  (Doc. 472 at 8).  Ms. \\nMcCloud did not have private insurance, however she may have been eligible for \\nMedicaid coverage, and there is evidence that Petitioner filed a claim with Michigan \\nMedicaid to recover payment. (Doc. 472 Exh. A).  There is also evidence that had \\nMedicaid allowed Petitioner’s claim, which it instead denied as being untimely filed, \\nit would have paid in the amount of $130,951.17.  (Doc. 472 Exh. A).  Therefore, \\nRespondent argues that Petitioner would now be unjustly enriched if it is allowed to \\nrecover more than the $130,951.17 it would have received had it timely filed its \\nclaim with Michigan Medicaid.   \\nSeveral federal cases have discussed whether or not a hospital should be \\nallowed to assert a lien against a patient’s recovery from a third party tortfeasor \\nwhen that hospital has already recovered a portion of its bills from Medicaid.  All of \\n \\n7\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 8 of 9                                             \\n      \\nthese cases have held that when a hospital bills and accepts payment from \\nMedicaid, its claim must be treated as paid in full, and it may no longer seek to \\nrecover any fees from the patient or any other party.  See Evanston Hosp. v. Hauck, \\n1 F.3d 540 (7th Cir. 1993); Miller v. Gorski Wladyslaw Estate, 547 F.3d 273 (5th Cir. \\n2008).  Conversely, these cases indicate that when the hospital has not accepted \\npayment from Medicaid, it is free to seek full recovery from the patient.  See id.  \\nHere, because Michigan Medicaid denied its claim, Petitioner never actually \\naccepted payment from Michigan Medicaid, thus leaving all of Petitioner’s bills \\nunpaid.  Respondent argues that, nevertheless, Petitioner should be barred from \\nrecovering a greater amount now as it would be in essence receiving a windfall for \\nits failure to timely file its claim with Michigan Medicaid.  While this may be the \\ncase, because Petitioner never actually accepted payment from Michigan Medicaid, \\nprecedent dictates that it is free to seek full recovery from Respondent or any other \\nthird party source.  Accordingly, Respondent’s second objection also fails.     \\nB. Whether The Amount of the Lien is Reasonable and Necessary \\nNext, Respondent argues that Petitioner’s Lien should be denied because \\nPetitioner did not satisfy its burden of showing that its charges were reasonable or \\ncustomary.  (Doc. 472 at 11).  However, as Magistrate Judge Gorman found in his \\nOrder denying Respondent’s Motion to Compel Discovery (Doc. 469) on this issue, \\nthe bills upon which Petitioner now seeks to recover were presented to the jury as \\npart of Respondent’s damages at trial.  Moreover, the jury there found that \\nRespondent’s medical bills were reasonable.  (Doc. 378 at 1).  Respondent may not \\nrely upon Petitioner’s medical bills as part of its case before the jury, but now, when \\n \\n8\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 481    Page 9 of 9                                             \\n      \\nPetitioner seeks to recover upon them, dispute that they were not reasonable or \\nnecessary.   Therefore, this objection also fails.   \\nC. Prior Acceptance of Payment \\nFinally, Respondent argues that Petitioner should be barred from recovering \\non its lien because “it is apparent that one of the bills for services rendered to Ms. \\nMcCloud was submitted by [P]etitioner to Michigan Medicaid for reimbursement in \\ntimely fashion and the claim was paid.”  (Doc. 472 at 15).  However, as Petitioner \\npointed out in its Response to Respondent’s Brief (Doc. 475), the payment to which \\nRespondent points was not made to Petitioner, but to a separate doctor, Doctor \\nBenito Camacho.  (See Doc. 472 Exh. B). Accordingly, Respondent’s claim for \\nreduction is utterly without merit, and its final objection is also denied.   \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\nFor the foregoing reasons, Respondent’s Objections to and Motion for \\nReconsideration of the Magistrate’s Order (Doc. 479) is GRANTED in part and \\nDENIED in part.  It is granted to the extent that the Court has here reconsidered \\nportions of Magistrate Judge Gorman’s Order, however all of its objections are \\nDENIED.  The Order of Magistrate Judge Gorman is AFFIRMED, Petitioner’s \\nPetition to Adjudicate Liens (Doc. 445) is GRANTED, and its Lien of $261,902.33 is \\nto be paid in full.  IT IS SO ORDERED.   \\n \\nEntered this 18th day of April, 2011.            \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n9\\n            s/ Joe B.

That motorcycle accident is the subject of this\\nlitigation. The billed amount for those goods and services was $261,902.33. When this lawsuit was\\nfiled, OSF served a lien against the injury claim for that amount. \\nTrish McCloud’s claim was tried to a jury, which rendered a Verdict in her favor, awarding\\ndamages in the amount of $15,000,000.14. That Verdict was itemized; the amount awarded for\\npayment of past medical care, treatment, services and life care needs was $472,794.14. (See Verdict,\\nDoc. #378). That amount, which included the OSF bills, was presented by the Plaintiff as part of\\nstipulated medical expenses, the reasonableness of which was undisputed at trial.\\nThe Verdict was appealed, and on appeal the parties participated in the Seventh Circuit’s\\nsettlement process. The case was settled for a confidential amount. The settlement was approved by\\nthe Court on December 10, 2008. The approval included attorney’s fees of 40% of the settlement\\namount plus expenses, which totaled $551,811.73.\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 2 of 6                                             \\n      \\nAfter the settlement fund was established and paid, Plaintiff’s lawyers and OSF lawyers began\\nnegotiations over satisfaction of the lien. They have been unsuccessful in resolving their differences.\\nOSF maintains that it is entitled to the entire amount of its lien, while Plaintiff contends that the\\nsettlement amount is subject to the common fund doctrine1 and should accordingly be reduced by 40%\\nfor attorney fees and by pro-rata litigation expenses.\\n OSF seeks adjudication of its lien pursuant to the Healthcare Services Lien Act2, 770 ILCS\\n23/30, which provides in pertinent part:\\n§ 30. Adjudication of rights. On petition filed by the injured person or the health care\\nprofessional or health care provider and on the petitioner's written notice to all interested\\nadverse parties, the circuit court shall adjudicate the rights of all interested parties and enforce\\ntheir liens. \\nUnder this Act, so long as the total amount of liens is less than 40% of the verdict or\\nsettlement, the lien is enforceable. 770 ILCS 23/10(c). There is no dispute between Plaintiff and OSF\\nthat the amount of liens is less than 40% of the settlement. What is not clear, however, is whether the\\nlien is subject to the common fund doctrine. \\nThe question whether the common fund doctrine applies to liens of medical providers was\\nmentioned in Baier v. State Farm Ins. Co., 361 N.E.2d 1100 (Ill.1977). In that case, the plaintiff was\\nan attorney who had represented a plaintiff in an automobile accident case. His client’s insurer had\\npaid his client $1000, which was the policy limit for medical bills. To obtain that amount, his client\\n1In an Order entered earlier in this case (See Order, Doc. #469), a motion to compel was\\ndenied. In that Order, the Court found specifically that Plaintiff would not be allowed to challenge\\nthe jury’s finding that Plaintiff’s medical bills, including those from OSF, were reasonable and\\ncustomary, either directly or indirectly. Plaintiff’s indirect challenges were based on what an\\ninsured patient would have paid and what Medicaid would have paid. In the briefing regarding\\nadjudication of the OSF lien, these issues were again raised; they are again rejected. \\n2This case is in federal court on diversity jurisdiction, so Illinois law governing liens\\napplies to this dispute. \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 3 of 6                                             \\n      \\nhad signed a document reflecting that the payment was a “loan” to be repaid only “in the event and\\nto the extent that any net recovery is made” from a tortfeasor. The document also required the insured\\nto sue if there was a basis for doing so. Suit was filed and the insurer notified the other driver’s insurer\\nthat it claimed $1000 subrogation rights from any proceeds in the case.\\nThe attorney obtained a settlement of $12,000. The other driver’s insurer paid in 2 drafts: one\\nfor $11,000 payable to the attorney and his client and one for $1000 payable to the insurer for $1000.\\nIn the course of deciding whether the common fund doctrine applied to the subrogor/subrogee\\nrelationship (the Supreme Court held that it did), the Baier Court noted that the insurer had\\nhypothesized that if the doctrine applied to the subrogor/ subrogee relationship, then it might also\\napply to a medical provider who had rendered medical services. Because the case before it did not\\npresent that question, the Court declined to consider it. 361 N.E.2d at 1102. In reaching its decision,\\nthe Baier Court commented that the common fund doctrine is based on the “equitable concept that an\\nattorney who performs services in creating a fund should in equity and good conscience be allowed\\ncompensation out of the whole fund from all those who seek to benefit from it.” 361 N.E.2d at 1102.\\nShortly after Baier was decided, the issue of whether the common fund doctrine applies to\\nhospital liens presented itself squarely. In Maynard v. Parker, 387 N.E.2d 298 (Ill.1979), the plaintiff\\nsued for injuries sustained in a car accident. His damages included $11,027.96 for his hospital bill.\\nUnder the then-extant hospital liens act, the hospital noticed its lien. The case settled for $37,500.\\nDefendant’s insurer issued a draft for $11,027.96 to the Plaintiff, his wife, his attorney and the\\nhospital. The hospital then filed its petition to adjudicate the rights of the parties to that amount. The\\ntrial court ordered that the hospital pay from the total amount one-third of the costs incurred ($205.48)\\nand one-third of the total for attorney’s fees. The hospital appealed, and the appellate court reversed.\\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 4 of 6                                             \\n      \\nBefore the Supreme Court, the plaintiff argued that the trial court had properly applied the\\ncommon fund doctrine. The Supreme Court rejected that argument, finding two “important\\ndistinctions” between the case before it and Baier. First, the types of relationships between the parties\\nin Baier differed significantly: “Here, the plaintiff’s liability to the hospital was not dependent upon\\nthe creation of a fund; plaintiff was a debtor obligated to pay for the services rendered by the hospital\\nout of any resources which might become available to him.” Id. at 300. Unlike Baier, where the\\nsubrogor and subrogee stood in the same shoes, the Plaintiff and the hospital had entirely separate\\nlegal interests and obligations. Second, there was no limitation on the amount of the lien that could\\nbe claimed in Baier, whereas the amount of the lien in Maynard could not, pursuant to the Lien Act,\\n“exceed one-third of the sum paid or due to said injured person...” Id, quoting Ill. Rev. Stat.1975, ch.\\n82 ¶ 97. Because of these two distinctions, the Court concluded that the common fund doctrine was\\nnot applicable to hospital liens.\\nThe common fund doctrine again reached the State Supreme Court in Bishop v. Burgard, 764\\nN.E.2d 24 (Ill.2002). In that case, an employee sued the driver of the other vehicle involved in a car\\naccident that had injured the employee. She signed a contingency agreement with her attorney. The\\nemployee’s medical bills, totaling $8,576.30, had been paid by the employer’s medical plan, which\\nhad noticed its lien in that amount against the proceeds of the lawsuit. The case settled for $21,500.\\nPlaintiff’s attorney was unsuccessful in efforts to have the Plan reduce its lien by one-third to reflect\\nattorney’s fees, so he filed a petition to adjudicate the lien. The issues presented included whether\\nERISA preempted the doctrine in this context and, if not, whether the doctrine applied or whether the\\nterms of the plan prevailed. In addition, if the terms of the plan prevailed, there remained the question\\nwhether the terms of the plan were unenforceable as a violation of public policy. \\nThe Bishop Court relied on Ragan v. Columbia Mutual Ins. Co., 701 N.E.2d 493 (1998), which\\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 5 of 6                                             \\n      \\nhad held that ERISA does not preempt the common fund doctrine. Finding nothing in the case before\\nit that would call Scholtens into question either substantively or on the facts, the Court applied\\nScholtens. The Court emphasized that ERISA does not preempt the doctrine because the claim for\\nattorney’s fees arises independently of both the benefit plan and the subrogation agreement. Bishop,\\n764 N.E.2d at 31. See Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Svc. Inc., 486 U.S. 825, 833 n.8\\n(1988)(noting in dicta that common fund claims for attorney’s fees are not preempted by ERISA).\\nFurthermore, because of its independent nature, a common fund claim for attorney’s fees is not\\ngoverned by the terms of the plan. Bishop, 764 N.E.2d at 34.\\nA few months ago, the Illinois Court of Appeals for the Fifth District decided Howell v.\\nDunaway, 924 N.E.2d 1190 (Ill.App.2010). The Howell Court found that, in Bishop, the Supreme\\nCourt had expanded the common fund doctrine from its expression in Maynard, shifting the focus from\\nthe relationship between the parties to the “real question” of “whether the claimant had benefitted from\\nthe lawsuit without contributing to its costs, thereby becoming unjustly enriched.” Id. at 1195. The\\nHowell Court pointed out that the relationship between a plaintiff and a hospital/lienholder is much\\nmore like a subrogor/subrogee relationship “than the court in Maynard recognized.” Id.. \\nWith all due respect to the Howell Court, the Supreme Court of Illinois has spoken, clearly and\\nunambiguously: the common fund doctrine does not apply to hospital liens. Moreover, I do not believe\\nthat the Supreme Court will adopt the reasoning used by the Fifth Circuit in Howell.  The “shift in\\nfocus” noted by the Howell Court is not nearly as pervasive as that Court would have it.  In Bishop,\\nthe Supreme Court emphasized the centrality of the nature of the relationship between the parties,\\nemphasizing that  the quasi-contractual right to payment of fees was independent of and irrelevant to\\nthe contractual relationship between the health care plan and the beneficiary.   764 N.E.2d at 31. It was\\nonly in the context of those  relationships that the Court reached its decision that ERISA did not\\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 478    Page 6 of 6                                             \\n      \\npreempt the common fund doctrine as it applies to attorney’s fees claims. Bishop demonstrates with\\nsome force that the nature of the relationship between the parties remains crucial in deciding whether\\nthe common fund doctrine applies.  There is nothing in that opinion to suggest that a reconsideration\\nof Maynard is forthcoming.  \\n Other than the Howell challenge to the lien, Plaintiff has raised no other significant issue. I\\nconclude that Maynard applies, and under Maynard, the lien asserted by OSF is not subject to the\\ncommon fund doctrine.\\nThe OSF lien is therefore to be paid in full. The Petition by OSF is allowed. \\nENTERED ON July 13, 2010 \\ns/ John A. Gorman \\nJOHN A.

Petitioner states that it holds a hospital lien \\npursuant to the Illinois Health Care Services Lien Act, 770 ILCS 23/1 et seq., \\nagainst a jury verdict and judgment obtained by Trish Lee McCloud in this Court.  \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 448    Page 2 of 3                                             \\n      \\nMs. McCloud1 admits that her attorney did receive notice of the lien, but denies that \\nshe recovered the amount of the jury verdict.  Moreover, Ms. McCloud states that \\nPetitioner would be unjustly enriched if it collects the claimed amount of the lien \\nfrom her, because Petitioner already accepted Medicaid payment and a tax write-off \\nof the claimed expenses.  (Doc. 447).   \\n \\nOn August 24, 2007, a jury verdict in the amount of $15,000,000.14 was \\nentered in this case in favor of Ms. McCloud.  (Doc. 378).  A judgment for this \\namount followed on August 30, 2007.  (Doc. 382).  However, Defendant Goodyear \\nDunlop Tires North America filed a Notice of Appeal on June 24, 2008.  (Doc. 422).  \\nDuring the appeal, the parties negotiated a settlement, and they moved the Court to \\napprove the settlement and requested the Court of Appeals to remand the case for \\nthat purpose.  (Doc. 432).  The Court subsequently vacated the August 30, 2007 \\njudgment, approved the terms of the confidential settlement2 after a fairness \\nhearing, and dismissed the case with prejudice.  (Doc. 436).                  \\n \\n \\nIn its Petition to Adjudicate Liens, Petitioner relies on the August 24, 2007 \\njury verdict.  As Ms. McCloud asserts, she did not recover payment on the jury \\nverdict, as the judgment arising from it was vacated.  Therefore, no lien can exist \\nagainst the jury verdict or the judgment arising from it.  In re Estate of Cooper, 532 \\nN.E.2d 236, 238-39 (Ill. 1988) (“Only when a recovery is made can the lien come into \\nexistence, because absent a provision to the contrary, a lien is created only when \\n                                                           \\n1  \\nThe Petition to Adjudicate Liens names Ms. McCloud, Conybeare Law Office, \\nand Randy James & Associates as Respondents.

Northwestern \\nMemorial Hosp., 888 N.E.2d 529, 542 (Ill. App. 2008).  On the other hand, if a \\nrecovery is made pursuant to a settlement, a lien may attach to the settlement \\nrecovery.  770 ILCS 23/20.  The total amount of all liens cannot exceed 40% of the \\ntotal recovery.  770 ILCS 23/10(a).     \\n \\nThe Court cannot adjudicate the lien on the basis of the record before it.  \\nTherefore, Petitioner SHALL submit further briefing on Ms. McCloud’s claim that it \\nwill be unjustly enriched by recovery under its alleged lien because of Medicaid \\npayments and tax write-offs.  Ms. McCloud SHALL submit further briefing as to her \\ncompliance with the terms of the settlement agreement relating to liens, her claim \\nthat Petitioner’s billed charges were not reasonable and customary, and whether \\nand to what extent Petitioner is entitled to recover payment from Ms. McCloud’s \\nsettlement recovery for its services to Ms. McCloud.  In addition, the parties are \\ninstructed to brief other issues that will be helpful to the Court.  The additional \\nbriefing from both Petitioner and Ms. McCloud SHALL be submitted to the Court \\nwithin 21 days of the date of this Order.   \\n \\n \\n \\nEntered this 15th day of December, 2009.            \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3\\n             s/ Joe B.

At the \\nfinal pretrial conference this Court ordered expedited briefing \\non this issue and Granted Defendants leave to file a Reply \\nBrief.  Defendants filed their Reply Brief [Doc. 229] on July 2, \\n2007.  For the following reasons, this Court holds that Illinois \\nLaw governs this case and Defendants Motion [Doc. 217] is \\nDENIED. \\n   \\n \\n  \\nI. \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\nThis case arises out of a motorcycle accident that occurred \\n \\non Interstate 55 in Livingston County, Illinois.  Plaintiff, \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 2 of 16                                            \\n       \\nTrish McCloud was riding on the back of a motorcycle driven by \\nPlaintiff, William Booker.1  Together they were returning to \\nBaldwin, Michigan from a “blessing of the bikes” event in East \\nSaint Louis, Illinois.  (Doc. 224 at 8.)  \\n \\nThe motorcycle they were riding on was a 1985 Honda \\nGoldwing with tires that were manufactured by Goodyear Dunlop \\nTires of North America, Ltd. (“Dunlop”).  While traveling \\nNorthbound on Interstate 55, the rear tire of the motorcycle \\n“suddenly and catastrophically deflated.”  (Doc. 218 at 1.)  As \\na result of the accident, McCloud was permanently and severely \\ndisabled.   \\nPlaintiff alleges that the accident was caused by a \\ndefectively manufactured rear tire.  Defendants, on the other \\nhand, argue that the reason for the blowout was that the tire \\nhad been run overloaded and underinflated for a long period of \\ntime.  \\nOn June 13, 2007, Defendants filed the Motion currently \\nbefore the Court in which they allege that Michigan law should \\napply to the facts of this case.  Plaintiff, in Response, argues \\nthat Illinois law should apply.  To that end, there are several \\nadditional facts which are integral to the matter at bar.  \\n                                                           \\n1 Since the briefs were filed related to this Order, Plaintiff \\nWilliam Booker has dismissed his claims against Defendants and \\nno longer is a party to this case.  \\n \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 3 of 16                                            \\n       \\nDefendants emphasize the following; Booker purchased the \\ntire and that it was installed at a store in Michigan; At the \\ntime of the accident, both Booker and McCloud were residents of \\nMichigan (Doc. 218 at 4-5.); And, according to Defendants, “the \\nevidence shows that Booker used the motorcycle with the subject \\ntire for two years, primarily in Michigan....” (Doc. 218 at 2.)  \\nHowever, Defendants do not provide any evidence which would \\nsupport their assertion that the motorcycle was primarily used \\nin Michigan.  \\nPlaintiff, on the other hand, reiterates that the accident \\noccurred in Illinois and that she and Booker were traveling back \\nfrom East Saint Louis, Illinois.  In addition, McCloud states \\nthat St. Francis Medical Center, an Illinois non-profit \\ncorporation, has a lien for $261,902.32 against any recovery she \\nmight have in this action.  (Doc. 224 at 8.)  And finally, \\nPlaintiff points to evidence that shows that the subject tire \\nwas primarily used in Illinois.  Specifically, Plaintiff points \\nto Booker’s deposition testimony in which Booker discusses the \\nadditional trips that he made on the subject tire.  From there, \\nMcCloud puts together several computations from which she \\nconcludes that 32 percent of the miles accumulated on the \\nsubject tire were accumulated in Illinois, 26 percent were in \\nMichigan, 19 percent were in Indiana, 8 percent were in Ohio, 6 \\npercent were in Kentucky, 5 percent were in Tennessee, and 4 \\n \\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 4 of 16                                            \\n       \\npercent were in Alabama.  Defendants do not raise any facts \\nchallenging this computational analysis in their Reply Brief \\n(Doc. 229).  As a result, this Court concludes that more miles \\nwere placed on the subject tire in Illinois than in any other \\nstate. \\nII. \\nANALYSIS \\n \\nFederal courts apply the choice of law rules of the state \\nwhere the matter was originally filed.  Klaxon Co. v. Stentor \\nElectric Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941).  The case at bar was \\nfiled in the Central District of Illinois, so Illinois’ choice \\nof law rules apply.   \\nIllinois follows the “most significant relationship” \\napproach.  Ingersoll v. Klein, 262 N.E.2d 593, 596 (Ill. 1970).  \\nThis approach is laid out in the Restatement (Second) of \\nConflict of Law § 145.  Under this approach there is a \\npresumption that the law of the state where the injury occurred \\nshould govern.  Ingersoll, 262 N.E.2d at 595.  That presumption \\ncan be overcome if there is another state that has a more \\nsignificant relationship to the occurrence or the parties.  To \\ndetermine which state has a more significant relationship, our \\nAppellate Court has paraphrased the two relevant sets of \\ncriteria as follows: \\n“The first set of criteria includes general \\nfactors such as the needs of the interstate system; \\n \\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 5 of 16                                            \\n       \\nrelevant policies of the forum and other interested \\nstates; protection of justified expectations; the \\nbasic policies underlying the particular field of law; \\ncertainty, predictability and uniformity of result; \\nand ease in the determination and application of the \\nlaw to be applied. The second set of criteria includes \\nthe contacts to be taken into account in applying \\nthese principles. These contacts are: (1) the place of \\nthe injury; (2) the place of misconduct; (3) the \\ndomicile, residence, nationality, place of \\nincorporation and place of business of the parties; \\nand (4) the place where the relationship between the \\nparties is centered.” \\nIn re Air Crash Disaster Near Chicago, Illinois on May \\n25, 1979, 644 F.2d 594, 611-12 (7th Cir. 1981). \\n \\nFurthermore, our appellate court has ruled that the choice \\nof law determination for each relevant issue is severable.  \\nSpecifically, “[t]he application of choice-or-law rules is not a \\nmechanical process of cranking various factors through a \\nformula.  Critical to conflicts analysis is the notion that \\n[courts] must examine the choice-of-law rules not with regard to \\nvarious states’ interests in general, but precisely, with regard \\nto each state’s interest in the specific question [at bar].”  \\nId.  As a result, courts are to embrace the doctrine of depecage \\nin which a court separately considers which state’s law governs \\neach substantive issue.  If there are multiple issues which \\nwould be resolved differently under the law of two potentially \\ninterested jurisdictions, then a court must analyze these issues \\nseparately.  \\n  \\n \\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 6 of 16                                            \\n       \\nIn the case at bar, both sides agree that Illinois and \\nMichigan law have substantive differences regarding certain \\nissues relevant to this case. Illinois applies strict liability \\nto certain claims for manufacturing defects, See Blue v. \\nEnvironmental Engineering, Inc., 828 N.E.2d 1128 (2005), while \\nMichigan bases claims for manufacturing defects in negligence.  \\nPrentis v. Yale Mfg. Co., 421 Mich. 670 (Mich. 1984).  Illinois \\nrecognizes comparative negligence and bars recovery where the \\nplaintiff’s negligence is greater than fifty percent, 735 ILCS \\n5/2-1116, while Michigan has a system of pure comparative \\nnegligence so a plaintiff’s recovery is diminished by the \\npercentage of the plaintiff’s fault.  M.C.L. § 600.2959.  And, \\nMichigan has capped non-economic damages in product liability \\nactions at $500,000 in cases such as this.  M.C.L § 600.2946a.  \\n \\nThere is no dispute that there are certain facts in the \\ncase at bar which weigh heavily in favor of applying Illinois \\nlaw.  First, the accident occurred in Illinois.  As already \\nnoted, this alone creates a presumption that Illinois law \\napplies.  Secondly, under the Defendant’s theory of liability, \\nthe accident occurred because the subject tire was overloaded \\nand underinflated.  Since the tire was used in Illinois more \\n \\n6\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 7 of 16                                            \\n       \\nthan any other state, under the Defendant’s theory of liability, \\nthe injury causing conduct occurred primarily in Illinois.2  \\nFinally, on the trip in question, Plaintiff was returning \\nfrom her destination in Illinois.  This is relevant because \\nDefendants repeatedly argue that the injury “fortuitously” \\noccurred in Illinois because Plaintiff was simply passing \\nthrough the state. (Doc. 218 at 8, citing Schulze v. Illinois \\nHighway Transportation Co., 423 N.E.2d 278 (3rd Dist. 1981)).  In \\nparticular, Defendants repeatedly attempt to equate this case to \\nan airplane accident in which a plane fortuitously crashes in a \\nparticular state without any other connections to the situs of \\nthe crash.  (Doc. 218, citing In re Air Crash Disaster Near \\nRoselawn, Indiana on October 31, 1994, 926 F.Supp. 736, 742-43 \\n(N.D.Ill. 1996)(“Roselawn III”).  However, the facts do not \\nmirror the parallel that Defendants wish to draw.  At the time \\nof the accident, Plaintiff had specifically traveled to a \\nlocation in Illinois (the “blessing of the bikes” in East Saint \\nLouis, Illinois), and was on her return journey from East Saint \\nLouis, Illinois when the accident occurred.  It was not a random \\noccurrence that the accident happened in Illinois because the \\nmajority of miles over the life of the bike were from roads \\n                                                           \\n2 Under the Plaintiff’s theory of liability the injury causing \\nconduct was the faulty manufacturing of the tire in New York.  \\nSince no party is arguing for application of New York law, this \\nfact does not weigh in either party’s favor and is not relevant \\nto the analysis for choosing between Illinois and Michigan law.  \\n \\n7\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 8 of 16                                            \\n       \\ntraveled in Illinois.  Furthermore, the majority of the trip in \\nquestion was spent in Illinois and the destination of the trip \\nwas Illinois.  As a result, the fact that the accident occurred \\nin Illinois was not “fortuitous” but was instead a byproduct of \\nthe Plaintiff’s chosen journeys to and through Illinois.3  \\n \\nTogether, these facts create a strong presumption that \\nIllinois law should apply.  As a result, under the doctrine of \\ndepacage Defendant has the burden of pointing to the specific \\nareas of law where Michigan law should govern, and must put \\nforward strong policy considerations for applying Michigan law.  \\nIn the case at bar, Defendants put forward policy consideration \\nin the areas of 1) liability and 2) damages.4  For the following \\n                                                           \\n3 Defendants seem to semantically argue in favor of the word \\n“fortuitous” and state that “regardless of the fact that 32% of \\nthe tires total mileage accrued in Illinois, there was still a \\ngreater chance that the failure could have happened in the other \\nstates where the remaining 68% usage occurred.”  Defendants are \\ncorrect in that any time a random accident occurs in interstate \\ntravel its location is technically “fortuitous.”  However, in \\nthe case at bar, more miles were placed on the tire in Illinois \\nthan any other state.  And, Plaintiff was specifically on a trip \\nto Illinois.  As a result, based on the evidence before the \\nCourt, the accident and resulting injuries were more likely to \\noccur in Illinois than any other state.  \\n  Defendants state that they wish for Michigan’s comparative \\nfault law to apply.  However, Defendants do not put forward any \\npolicy analysis in their initial brief (Doc. 218) which would \\nassist this Court in concluding that Michigan law should apply \\nto this issue.   \\n 4\\n \\n8\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 9 of 16                                            \\n       \\nreasons Defendants’ policy considerations do not overcome the \\npresumption that Illinois law applies.5  \\n1. Liability \\nDefendants argue that the relationship between the parties \\nwas formed in Michigan.  Specifically, William Booker purchased \\nthe motorcycle tires in Michigan.  And, Trish McCloud chose to \\nbegin the journey in question on Booker’s motorcycle in \\nMichigan.  By getting on the motorcycle in Michigan she formed \\nher trust in the motorcycle and its wheels in Michigan.  \\nDefendants argue that because the relationship was formed \\nin Michigan, and because Plaintiff was a resident of Michigan at \\nthe time of the accident, policy concerns favor application of \\nMichigan liability law.   \\nIllinois has adopted the concept of strict liability in \\nproducts liability cases.  Garrison v. Heublein, Inc., 673 F.2d \\n189 (7th Cir. 1982).  In a product liability case, to recover \\nunder strict liability, a Plaintiff must show that an injury \\nresulted from a condition of the product, the condition must be \\nunreasonably dangerous, and the condition must have existed at \\n                                                           \\n5 Plaintiff’s primary argument in response is that Defendants’ \\nhave not filed a timely request for an application of Michigan \\nlaw.   The Defendant’s choice of law determination is not \\nsubject to the Court’s dispositive motion deadline.  \\nFurthermore, Plaintiff does not point to any local rule or other \\nauthority which requires that a choice of law motion be filed by \\na specific time.  Accordingly, the Court will not dispose of \\nDefendants’ request as untimely.  \\n \\n \\n9\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 10 of 16                                           \\n        \\nthe time the product left the manufacturer's control.  30A Ill. \\nLaw and Prac. Products Liability § 3.  \\nMichigan, on the other hand applies negligence law to \\nproducts liability claims.  In re Disaster at Detroit \\nMetropolitan Airport on August 16, 1987, 750 F.Supp. 793, 801 \\n(E.D.Mich. 1989).  According to Defendants, Michigan has adopted \\nthis policy to ensure that the public would not be “deprived of \\na product” absent a showing of fault.  Specifically, the \\nnegligence standard “incorporates greater intrinsic fairness in \\nthat the careful safety oriented manufacturer will not bear the \\nburden of paying for losses caused by the negligent product \\nseller....”  Prentis, 421 Mich. at 690.   \\nHowever, in the case at bar, Defendants have not argue that \\na “negligent product seller” caused the tire’s alleged defects.  \\n(Defendants Amended Answer – Doc. 36.)  Instead, they have \\nrepeatedly argued that the tire ruptured because Booker \\noverloaded and underinflated the subject tire.  Defendants can \\nstill make this argument because under Illinois law Plaintiff \\nmust show that the tire in question was defective ‘at the time \\nit left Defendants’ control.’  If Booker overloaded and \\nunderinflated the tire and this caused the tires’ relevant \\ndefects, then the defects did not exist when the tire left \\nDefendants’ control.  In such a case, Plaintiff would be lacking \\nan essential element to recover under Illinois’ strict liability \\n \\n10\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 11 of 16                                           \\n        \\nlaw.  As a result, the policy considerations regarding a \\nnegligent product seller put forward by Defendants (Doc. 218 at \\n12) do not apply in this case and certainly do not overcome the \\npresumption that Illinois law governs. \\n2. Damages \\nThe laws regarding damages in Illinois and Michigan are \\nvastly different.  Michigan law caps non-economic damages at \\n$500,000 in cases such as this. Michigan Comp. Laws § 600.2946a \\n(2003).  Michigan also allows damages to be reduced because of \\ncollateral source payments.  Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.6303(a).  \\nAnd, Michigan requires a court to reduce both future economic \\nand non-economic damages to their present cash value.  Mich. \\nComp. Laws § 600.6306.  Illinois, on the other hand, does not \\nhave a cap on damages, does not allow for evidence of collateral \\nsource payments, and only requires a court to reduce future \\neconomic damages.  \\nDefendants repeatedly emphasize that Plaintiff was an \\nIllinois resident at the time of the accident, and that the tire \\nwas sold in Michigan.  Accordingly, Defendants argue that \\nMichigan law should apply to the issue of damages. Defendants \\ncite Roselawn III, 926 F.Supp. at 746, which states that  \\n“[t]he choice of law of the plaintiff’s domicile \\nis the most sensible solution to conflicts concerning \\ncompensatory damages.  The reason is that the \\nplaintiff’s state has the most significant interest in \\nthe compensation of its domiciliaries.  It is \\n \\n11\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 12 of 16                                           \\n        \\ninconceivable that a plaintiff’s state’s limits upon \\ncompensation can be said to constitute a desire to \\ngive its residents less than complete compensation.”6   \\n In response, Plaintiff focuses on the statutory cap on \\ndamages and points to a recent state appellate opinion.  \\nTownsend ex rel. Townsend v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 858 N.E.2d \\n552 (Ill. App. 1st 2006).  In Townsend, an Illinois Appellate \\nCourt ruled that a forum state has a compelling policy interest \\nin protecting against legislative encroachment into the \\njudiciaries’ right to determine damages.  The Illinois Supreme \\nCourt has previously ruled that a cap on damages violates the \\nseparation of powers clause in Illinois’ Constitution because it \\ninfringed on the judiciary’s right to determine damages.  See \\nBest v. Taylor Machine Works, 689 N.E.2d 1057, 1081 (Ill. 1997).  \\nAccording to Townsend, there is a compelling state interest in \\nprotecting the rights of the judiciary, and this interest \\n                                                           \\n6 This Court disagrees with the reasoning of the Roselawn III \\nCourt.  When placing caps on product liability damages a state \\nlegislature balances the interest of completely compensating \\ntheir injured residents against the risk that they could be over \\ncompensated by overly sympathetic juries that lack appropriate \\nbenchmarks for determining damages.  A resident of a state with \\nan overtly strict limit on damages could legitimately disagree \\nwith his own legislature and, if impassioned enough, choose to \\nvacation outside of his state and into a forum which placed a \\ngreater emphasis on product safety.  Or, a severely and \\npermanently injured resident of the overtly strict forum could \\nbelieve that his legislature has barred him from being complete \\ncompensation.  This is not to say that Michigan’s laws are \\nstrict.  Instead, it is simply to point out that it is quite \\n‘conceivable’ that a plaintiff could persuasively argue that his \\nown state’s limits on damages have left him less than \\n‘completely compensated.’  \\n  \\n \\n12\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 13 of 16                                           \\n        \\noverrides any interest that the foreign state might have in \\ncapping non-economic damages.  Id. at 912-914.  As a result, a \\ncourt is required to consider that interest when making a choice \\nof law determination.  And, all other things being equal, \\nIllinois interest in keeping decisions on damages in the hands \\nof the judiciary overrides any interest that Michigan may have \\nin applying their cap.  \\n \\nAs long as Townsend is valid law in Illinois,7 Illinois law \\ngoverning caps on damages applies to this case.  Furthermore, \\nunder the facts before the Court, even without Townsend, \\nIllinois law still governs the issue of damages. \\n \\nDefendants argue correctly that Michigan has an interest in \\nchoosing how well its residents are compensated for their \\ninjuries from defective products.  However, Illinois also has an \\ninterest in any damage award that Plaintiff may receive because \\nIllinois has an interest in making sure that tourists visiting \\n                                                           \\n7 Defendants point out that the Illinois Supreme Court has \\nrecently agreed to hear the appeal of Townsend.  Townsend v. \\nSears, Roebuck and Co., 865 N.E.2d 978 (table) (Ill. 2007).  \\nHowever, unless and until the Illinois Supreme Court issues an \\nopinion reversing the decision of the Illinois Appellate Court, \\nthe current Townsend opinion provides the best available \\nguidance on how the Illinois Supreme Court would rule on this \\nissue.  See Adams v. Fred Weber, Inc., 849 F.2d 1018, 1026 (7th \\nCir. 1988); McGeshick v. Choucair, 9 F.3d 1229, 1232 (7th Cir. \\n1993)(noting that a federal court can only diverge from a \\ndecision of a state appellate court if a party has presented \\n“good reason” for diverging from the appellate court’s \\ndecision).  \\n \\n13\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 14 of 16                                           \\n        \\nIllinois are adequately compensated for injuries that occur in \\nIllinois. \\nHere, it is important to emphasize that Plaintiff was not \\nsimply passing through Illinois, but was visiting Illinois.  \\nIllinois’ laws related to damages certainly do not favor the \\nproducers of products wishing to limit their liability.  \\nInstead, Illinois’ product liability laws allow for \\nmanufacturers to face higher damages and are thus further \\ndiscouraged from producing dangerous products.  For example, \\nIllinois law allows for greater liability because it does not \\nprovide a cap on damages, it does not allow for evidence of \\ncollateral source payments, and it only requires a court to \\nreduce future economic damages.  See Supra.  \\nIllinois has an interest in not only protecting its \\ncitizens but also its visitors from faulty products – even if \\nthat means providing greater damages (and greater protection) \\nthan a visitor might receive in his home state.  See Vlasic v. \\nWyndham, 451 F.Supp.2d 1005 (C.D.Ill. 2006)(ruling that Aruba \\nlaw applied to a tourist injured in Aruba and noting that Aruba \\nhas an interest in providing a safe environment for tourists).  \\nAnd, that policy interest is still advanced when a visitor is \\ninjured on a motorcycle that was purchased in a foreign state \\n \\n14\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 276    Page 15 of 16                                           \\n        \\nbut was ridden into Illinois.8  After all, Illinois wants to \\nencourage motorcyclists to visit the state of Illinois, even if \\nthey are visiting on motorcycles that are purchased elsewhere.  \\nIllinois’ interest in protecting its tourists would not \\nalone be enough to apply Illinois law.  However, it undermines \\nDefendants’ policy argument that a plaintiff’s home state is the \\nonly jurisdiction that has an interest in compensating the \\nvictims of a product liability action.  As a result, Defendants’ \\npolicy considerations regarding damages are not robust enough to \\novercome the fact that the injury occurred in Illinois, a \\nsubstantial part of the injury causing activity could likely \\nhave occurred in Illinois, and, as a visitor to Illinois, \\nPlaintiff has legitimate contacts with this state.  \\nIII.  \\nADDITIONAL ISSUES \\n \\nPlaintiff has filed a Motion for Leave to File a \\n \\nSupplemental Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion.  \\n[Doc. 230.]  Since the Court has ruled in Plaintiff’s Favor, the \\nrequest for additional briefing is MOOT. \\n \\nFurthermore, Defendants have filed a Motion to Reconsider \\n[Doc. 222] in which they request that this Court grant summary \\n                                                           \\n8 Defendants in this case cannot argue that they had no \\nreasonable expectation that they would ever be subjected to \\nIllinois law.   They have not put forward any evidence that they \\nhave tailored their manufacturing or distribution system to \\navoid liability in Illinois.

For the reasons that follow, Goodyear’s Motion for \\nSummary Judgment will be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 2 of 15                                            \\n       \\nI. \\nBackground \\nThe following facts are undisputed.  On or about May 26, \\n2002, driver William Booker (“Booker”) and passenger McCloud, \\nwere traveling on Booker’s 1985 Honda Goldwing motorcycle, going \\nnorthbound on Interstate 55 in Livingston County, Illinois, when \\nan allegedly defective rear tire “suddenly and catastrophically \\ndeflated,” resulting in personal injuries to both McCloud and \\nBooker.  As a result, on April 21, 2004, McCloud filed claims \\nfor strict liability and negligence against both Goodyear and \\nGoodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd. (“Dunlop”), alleging \\nthat the rear tire of the motorcycle -- which was a Dunlop \\nQualifier K6278150/90B15M/C74H DOT. No. DAWVM711200 -- was \\ndefective and unreasonably dangerous in design and manufacture.  \\nLikewise, on May 18, 2004, Booker also filed a complaint against \\nGoodyear and Dunlop alleging the same claims as McCloud.   \\nIn turn, Goodyear has filed the instant Motion for Summary \\nJudgment, alleging that it was not involved in the design, \\nmanufacture, assembly, advertising, selling, or distribution of \\nthe subject tire in this case.  See [Doc. #154, pg. 5]. \\nII. \\nLegal Standard \\nSummary judgment should be granted where “the pleadings, \\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party \\n  \\n  \\n \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 3 of 15                                            \\n       \\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \\n56(c).  The moving party has the responsibility of informing the \\nCourt as to portions of the record that demonstrate the absence \\nof a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \\n477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  The movant may meet this burden by \\ndemonstrating “that there is an absence of evidence to support \\nthe nonmoving party’s case.”  Id. at 325.   \\n \\nOnce the movant has met its burden, to survive summary \\njudgment the “nonmovant must show through specific evidence that \\na triable issue of fact remains on issues on which [s]he bears \\nthe burden of proof at trial.”  Warsco v. Preferred Tech. Group, \\n258 F.3d 557, 563 (7th Cir. 2001); see also Celotex Corp., 477 \\nU.S. at 322-24.  “The nonmovant may not rest upon mere \\nallegations in the pleadings or upon conclusory statements in \\naffidavits; it must go beyond the pleadings and support its \\ncontentions with proper documentary evidence.”  Chemsource, Inc. \\nv. Hub Group, Inc., 106 F.3d 1358, 1361 (7th Cir. 1997). \\n \\nThis Court must nonetheless “view the record and all \\ninferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the \\n[non-moving party].”  Holland v. Jefferson Nat. Life Ins. Co., \\n883 F.2d 1307, 1312 (7th Cir. 1989).  In doing so, this Court is \\nnot “required to draw every conceivable inference from the \\nrecord -- only those inferences that are reasonable.”  Bank \\nLeumi Le-Isreal, B.M. v. Lee, 928 F.2nd 232, 236 (7th Cir. \\n1991).  Therefore, if the record before the court “could not \\n \\n3\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 4 of 15                                            \\n       \\nlead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party,” \\nthen no genuine issue of material fact exists and, the moving \\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  McClendon v. \\nIndiana Sugars, Inc., 108 F.3d 789, 796 (7th Cir. 1997) (quoting \\nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, \\n587 (1986)).  However, in ruling on a motion for summary \\njudgment, the court may not weigh the evidence or resolve issues \\nof fact; disputed facts must be left for resolution at trial.  \\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986).   \\nIII. \\nAnalysis \\nThe Court first points out the there is a dispute between \\nthe parties as to which legal theory should apply in assessing \\nGoodyear’s liability in the underlying action.  McCloud argues \\nthat Goodyear should be liable for any defects regarding the \\ntire in question, because Goodyear held itself out to the public \\nand its investors as controlling the manufacturing processes and \\nsales at the Tonawanda plant in New York -- where the subject \\ntire was manufactured.  See Aebischer v. Stryker Corp., No. 05-\\n2121, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1619; 2006 WL 44307 (C.D. Ill. Jan. \\n9, 2006) (applying the “holding out theory”).  Goodyear, on the \\nother hand, argues that Aebischer does not apply to the instant \\nmatter but, instead, the Van Dorn test should apply because \\nMcCloud is attempting to pierce the corporate veil. \\n  \\n \\n4\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 5 of 15                                            \\n       \\nA review of McCloud’s complaint against Goodyear reveals a \\n \\nfactual basis to analyze Goodyear’s liability under both the \\n“holding out” theory and the Van Dorn test.  In her Complaint, \\nMcCloud asserts both strict liability and negligence theories of \\nrecovery against Goodyear.  Both theories of recovery, however, \\nhave different applicable legal standards.  See Bittler v. White \\nand Co., Inc., 560 N.E.2d 979, 982 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990). \\n \\nIn cases where a plaintiff attempts to hold a parent \\ncompany liable for the acts of its subsidiary under a negligence \\ntheory, the plaintiff must establish that either one corporation \\nwas the mere instrumentality of the other, or that one \\ncorporation was simply a dummy or sham and that failing to \\nimpose liability would justify a wrong or perpetuate a fraud.  \\nSee Main Bank of Chicago v. Baker, 427 N.E.2d 94, 101 (Ill. \\n1981).  This standard was later named the “Van Dorn” test, after \\nthe Seventh Circuit adopted this approach in Van Dorn Co. v \\nFuture Chemical & Oil Co., 753 F.2d 565 (7th Cir. 1985).  In \\nBaker, the Illinois Supreme Court explained that: \\n[B]efore the separate corporate identity of one \\ncorporation will be disregarded and treated as the \\nalter ego of another, it must be shown that it is so \\ncontrolled and its affairs so conducted that it is a \\nmere instrumentality of another, and it must further \\nappear that observance of the fiction of separate \\nexistence would, under the circumstances, sanction a \\nfraud or promote injustice. Id. at 101. \\nIn support of their contention that the Van Dorn test \\nshould not apply, McCloud relies on Chief District Judge Michael \\n \\n \\n5\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 6 of 15                                            \\n       \\nP. McCuskey’s recent decision in Aebischer v. Stryker Corp., No. \\n05-2121, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1619 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 9, 2006).  \\nAebischer came before the Court on a Motion to Amend the \\nComplaint in which the Plaintiff sought to file an amended \\ncomplaint which alleged that a Defendant held itself out as the \\nmanufacturer of an allegedly defective replacement hip, a \\ntypical product liability claim.  The Court noted that a party \\nholding itself out formed a basis for product liability claims \\n(as discussed below) and allowed the filing of the Amended \\nComplaint, denied Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment and \\nallowed further discovery.  See, Aebischer v. Stryker Corp. 2006 \\nWL 2038545 (C.D.Ill. Jul 19 2006) (considering a later motion to \\ncompel).  The Court did not perform any analysis regarding the \\nnegligence claim. Furthermore, the Court did not hold that the \\nVan Dorn test was not the correct measure for whether a \\nplaintiff should be able to pierce the corporate veil of a \\nparent corporation in a negligence claim. Therefore, Aebischer \\nis distinguishable with regard to Plaintiff’s negligence claim. \\n \\nSince one of McCloud’s claims seeks to impose negligent \\nliability upon Goodyear as a parent corporation for negligence \\ncommitted by, the subsidiary - Dunlop, the Van Dorn test applies \\nto McCloud’s negligence claims.  However, in regard to McCloud’s \\nstrict liability claims, the “holding out” theory is the correct \\nstandard to be applied.  See Connelly v. Uniroyal, Inc., 389 \\nN.E.2d 155 (Ill. 1979); see Also, Hebel v. Sherman Equipment, \\n \\n6\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 7 of 15                                            \\n       \\n442 N.E.2d 199 (Ill. 1982).  In all the Illinois cases in which \\na court has applied the “holding out” theory, the plaintiff was \\nproceeding against the defendant based on a products \\nliability/strict liability claim.  See Ogg v. City of \\nSpringfield, 458 N.E.2d 1331 (Ill. App. Ct. 1984); see also, \\nRoot v. JH Industries, Inc., 660 N.E.2d 195 (Ill. App. Ct. \\n1995); Hebel, 442 N.E.2d 199; Connelly, 370 N.E.2d 1189.  \\nAccordingly, the Court will first address Goodyear’s liability \\nas to Plaintiffs’ negligence claim under the Van Dorn test, and \\nthen Goodyear’s liability as to McCloud’s strict liability \\nclaims under the “holding out” theory. \\nA.  The “Van Dorn” Test \\n \\nIn cases where a plaintiff has attempted to hold a parent \\ncompany liable for the acts of its subsidiary for negligence, \\ncourts have repeatedly applied the Van Dorn test.  See Connelly, \\n370 N.E.2d at 1196;  Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Pepper Source, \\n941 F.2d 519 (7th Cir. 1991); Torco Oil Co. v. Innovative \\nThermal Corp., 763 F.Supp. 1445 (N.D.Ill. 1991); See also, Van \\nDorn, 753 F.2d at 569, 570.  In Van Dorn, the Seventh Circuit \\nheld that generally: \\n  “[u]nder Illinois law, a corporation is a legal \\nentity separate and distinct from its shareholders, \\ndirectors and officers, and, generally, from other \\ncorporations with which it may be affiliated.  \\nHowever, a corporate entity will be disregarded and \\nthe veil of limited liability pierced when two \\nrequirements are met: First, there must be such unity \\nof interest and ownership that the separate \\npersonalities of the corporation and the individual \\n \\n7\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 8 of 15                                            \\n       \\n[or other corporation] no longer exist; and second, \\ncircumstances must be such that adherence to the \\nfiction of a separate corporate existence would \\nsanction a fraud or promote injustice.”   \\n \\nId. at 569, 570 (citations omitted). \\n \\n1.  Unity of Interest \\n \\n“Stock control and the existence of common officers and \\ndirectors are generally prerequisites to the piercing of the \\ncorporate veil although these factors alone will not suffice.”  \\nHystro Products, Inc. v. MNP Corp., 18 F.3d 1384, 1389 (7th Cir. \\n1994)(citations omitted).  This is because, “[t]heoretically, \\nevery parent corporation, by virtue of its ownership interest, \\nhas the power, right, and ability to control the products of its \\nsubsidiary.”  Bunch v. Centeon, L.L.C., No. 99-C3511, 2000 U.S. \\nDist. LEXIS 17144, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 24, 2000).  Therefore, \\n“to hold a parent company liable for acts by a subsidiary, the \\nlegal separateness of the parent and subsidiary must have been \\ndisregarded in a wide range of matters.”  Bunch, 2000 U.S. Dist. \\nLEXIS 17144, at *6.   \\n \\nIn determining whether the requisite degree of control is \\nmaintained by one corporation over the affairs of another to \\njustify disregarding their separate corporate identities, the \\nIllinois courts have considered some of the following factors: \\n“(1) the failure to maintain adequate corporate records or to \\ncomply with corporate formalities, (2) the commingling of funds \\nor assets, (3) undercapitalization, and (4) one corporation \\n \\n8\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 9 of 15                                            \\n       \\ntreating the assets of another corporation as its own.”  Van \\nDorn, 753 F.2d at 570.  Some more factors that have also been \\nconsidered include: Who controlled the day-to-day operations, \\nmanufacturing and design processes, did the two corporations \\nshare the same employees, who controlled payroll, and, did the \\ntwo corporations have separate facilities?  Id. at 572; See \\nalso, Hystro Products, Inc., 18 F.3d at 1389. \\n \\nIn considering the first four factors as applied to the \\ncase at hand, it is unclear from the record whether Dunlop \\nfailed to maintain adequate corporate records or comply with \\ncorporate formalities, or that Dunlop was even undercapitalized.  \\nThe record, however, does indicate that Goodyear reported \\nDunlop’s profits and assets as their own.  In regards to the \\nother considerations, Plaintiffs’ allege that the policies and \\nprocedures for the operation of Dunlop’s business, including \\nproduct quality and safety of the tires it manufactures, have \\nbeen controlled by Goodyear since 1999.  However, the record to \\nwhich Plaintiffs’ cite to in support of this contention is \\nmerely a business conduct manual, and does not in any way \\nindicate whether Goodyear controls the day-to-day operations, \\nmanufacturing, and design processes of Dunlop.  Goodyear’s \\nfinancial report only indicates that after they acquired 75% of \\nDunlop’s interest, that in order to maximize market growth \\nopportunities, they effected a plan that included the downsizing \\nor consolidation of manufacturing, sales, support and \\n \\n9\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 10 of 15                                           \\n        \\ndistribution operations.  This definitely suggests that Goodyear \\ncontrolled the marketing processes, however, there is nothing \\nelse in the record that indicates whether they specifically \\ncontrolled the manufacturing and design processes at Dunlop’s \\nTonawanda Plant on a day-to-day basis.  Goodyear’s website \\nmerely indicates that Dunlop’s Tonawanda plant is a part of the \\nGoodyear family of companies which does not suggest that they \\ncontrolled Dunlop’s Tonawanda plant’s manufacturing, operation, \\nand design processes. \\n \\nGoodyear and Dunlop did not share the same employees, and \\nDunlop even had their own headquarters located in West Amherst, \\nNew York.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that \\nGoodyear has made a warranty of any kind to any person with \\nrespect to the specific tire in question, or even to motorcycle \\ntires period.  In fact, Dunlop manufactured the tire in question \\nin their Tonawanda plant, which meant that Goodyear neither \\nmanufactured nor was in possession of the tire in question at \\nany time.  Accordingly, the Court must find, with respect to \\nPlaintiffs’ \\nnegligence \\nclaims, \\nthat \\ndespite \\nGoodyear’s \\nsubstantial ownership of Dunlop’s stock, these two corporations \\nhave always operated as separate entities and continue to do so \\ntoday.  Therefore, the Court finds no basis on which to find \\nthat there is unity of interest and ownership that the separate \\npersonalities of Goodyear and Dunlop should be disregarded. \\n2.  Fraud or the Promotion of an Injustice \\n \\n10\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 11 of 15                                           \\n        \\nEven if the Court finds Goodyear to have sufficient control \\n \\nover Dunlop, to hold them liable for the negligent acts of \\nDunlop, the Plaintiffs have still not offered any proof of fraud \\nor that an injustice will result if they are not allowed to also \\nhold Goodyear liable.  The Van Dorn court held that, “[o]nce the \\nfirst element of the test is established, either the sanctioning \\nof a fraud (intentional wrongdoing) or the promotion of \\ninjustice, will satisfy the second element.  Van Dorn, 753 F.2d \\nat 570.  In order to satisfy the second requirement, Plaintiffs’ \\nmust establish more than the inability to collect on their \\njudgment.  Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Pepper Source, 993 F.2d 1309, \\n1311 (7th Cir. 1993).  Plaintiffs’ must establish a “wrong” such \\nas where: \\n“the common sense rules of adverse possession would be \\nundermined; former partners would be permitted to \\nskirt the legal rules concerning monetary obligations; \\na party would be unjustly enriched; a parent \\ncorporation that caused a sub’s liabilities and its \\ninability to pay for them would escape those \\nliabilities; or an intentional scheme to squirrel \\nassets into a liability-free corporation while heaping \\nliabilities upon an asset-free corporation would be \\nsuccessful.” \\n \\nId. at 1311, 1312 (quoting Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Pepper \\nSource, 941 F.2d 519, 524 (7th Cir. 1991)). \\n \\nIn the present case, Plaintiff, McCloud conceded that she \\nwas not able to find any evidence that would show, “that \\nadherence to the fiction of separate corporate existence,” in \\nthis case, “would sanction a fraud or promote injustice.” \\n \\n11\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 12 of 15                                           \\n        \\nCiting, Van Dorn, 753 F.2d at 569-70.  And since Plaintiff, \\nBooker, failed to respond to this Court’s order requesting \\nevidence to satisfy the second prong of the Van Dorn test, this \\nCourt concludes that Plaintiffs’ have failed to provide evidence \\nfrom which a reasonable jury could conclude that the second \\nprong of the Van Dorn test has been satisfied.  Accordingly, the \\nCourt grants Goodyear’s motion for summary judgment in part, as \\nit relates to Plaintiffs’ negligence claims against Goodyear. \\nB.  “Holding Out” Theory \\n \\nUnder Illinois law, “the law is clear that a company which \\nholds itself out to the public as the manufacturer of a product \\nis liable for the injuries caused by that product if it is found \\nto be unreasonably dangerous.”  Ogg, 458 N.E.2d at 1336 \\n(citations omitted).  In the past, the aim of the “holding out” \\ntheory or “apparent manufacturer” doctrine, was to provide a \\nremedy for consumers injured by unsafe products.  Hebel, 442 \\nN.E.2d at 202.  This same objective is now “achieved by the \\ndoctrine of strict products liability.”  Id.  In other words, \\n“[t]he function of the apparent-manufacturer doctrine has, as it \\nwere, been absorbed by the theory of sellers’ strict liability \\nin tort for injuries caused by unreasonably unsafe products.”  \\nId.  The Supreme Court of Illinois has held that: \\n“The primary rationale for imposing liability on the \\napparent manufacturer of a defective product is that \\nit has induced the purchasing public to believe that \\nit is the actual manufacturer, and to act on this \\nbelief-that is, to purchase the product in reliance on \\n \\n12\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 13 of 15                                           \\n        \\nthe apparent manufacturer’s reputation and skill in \\nmaking it.” \\n \\nId. at 203 (emphasis included). \\nTherefore, “whether a holding out has occurred must be \\njudged from the viewpoint of the purchasing public, and in light \\nof circumstances as of the time of purchase.”  Id.  Another \\nrationale which justifies imposing strict liability on \\nmanufacturers, “is based on the fact that [the manufacturers], \\nas part of the chain of distribution, are involved in and reap a \\nprofit from the placement of the allegedly defective product \\ninto the stream of commerce.”  Bittler, 560 N.E.2d at 981 \\n(citing Hebel, 442 N.E.2d 199).  Furthermore,  \\n“[e]ven parties who are not within the actual chain of \\ndistribution, but who play an integral role in the \\nmarketing enterprise of an allegedly defective product \\nand participate in the profits derived from placing \\nthe product into the stream of commerce, are held \\nliable under the doctrine of strict liability.” \\n \\nId. (citing Connelly, 389 N.E.2d 155). \\nIn the present case, the record definitely shows that \\nGoodyear reports Dunlop’s profits as their own, thereby \\nsupporting the notion that Goodyear reaps the profits from the \\ntires that Dunlop manufacturers and sells.  Whether Goodyear \\nprofits from Dunlop’s manufacture of motorcycle tires–-\\nspecifically, the tire in question–-is, however, disputable.  \\nThomas Johnson, Jr., the tire performance manager at Dunlop in \\n2005, stated that he “believed” the motorcycle operations at \\n  \\n  \\n \\n13\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 14 of 15                                           \\n        \\nDunlop were a separate entity from Goodyear’s purchase of \\nDunlop.   \\nHowever, a belief is not the same as actual knowledge, and \\nthere is nothing in the record that either proves or disproves \\nhis statement.  It is disputable whether Goodyear plays an \\nintegral role in the marketing of the allegedly defective tire.  \\nGoodyear took over the marketing of Dunlop, which includes the \\nsale of Dunlop products.  However, there is nothing in the \\nrecord to indicate whether Goodyear also took over the \\nmotorcycle division of Dunlop.  The record only states that \\nGoodyear acquired 75% of Dunlop’s interest, and with it, \\nDunlop’s tire sales and distribution operations.  The record \\ndoes not indicate which tire sales or distribution operations.   \\n \\nSummary judgment should be granted “where the pleadings, \\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, \\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine \\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is \\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \\n56(c).  If a material question of fact does exist, the Court \\nmust not grant summary judgment.   \\nIn this case, there are disputable questions of fact as to \\nwhether Goodyear was marketing Dunlop’s motorcycle operations \\nwhen they were marketing Dunlop’s products.  Based upon the \\nevidence before the Court, a reasonable jury could conclude that \\n \\n14\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 202    Page 15 of 15                                           \\n        \\nGoodyear was marketing Dunlop tires and was holding itself out \\nas the apparent manufacturer of Dunlop motorcycle tires. \\nAccordingly, this Court must deny Goodyear’s Motion for \\nSummary Judgment in part, as it relates to Plaintiffs’ strict \\nliability claims.  \\n  \\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendant’s Motion for Summary \\nJudgment [Doc. # 154] be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  \\nSummary Judgment is GRANTED in favor of Defendant on Count III \\nand DENIED as to Counts I and II.  \\nENTERED this   11th     day of December, 2006. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    s/ Joe Billy McDade___       \\n       Joe Billy McDade \\n United States District Judge \\n15', '1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 195    Page 1 of 3                                             \\nE-FILED\\n      \\n Monday, 14 August, 2006  08:59:03 AM \\n Clerk, U.S. District Court, ILCD\\nCase.

For the reasons that follow,\\nBooker’s Motion will be GRANTED.\\nOn August 5, 2005, Booker filed a motion for summary judgment\\non Defendants’ counterclaim for contribution pursuant to Illinois\\nstate law in connection with the claims of Plaintiff Trish Lee\\nMcCloud (“McCloud”).  In his Motion, Booker argued that Defendants’\\ncontribution claim was barred by the Illinois Joint Tortfeasor\\nDefendants.\\n---------------------------\\nWILLIAM BOOKER,\\nPlaintiff,\\nv.\\nGOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES NORTH\\nAMERICA, LTD. and THE \\nGOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER\\nCOMPANY,\\nDefendants.\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 195    Page 2 of 3                                             \\n      \\nContribution Act (“Contribution Act”) since McCloud’s claim against\\nBooker was settled in good faith.  Defendants failed to respond to\\nBooker’s Motion and, on September 23, 2005, this Court held that\\nthere was no genuine issue as to any material fact in dispute and,\\nthat Booker’s settlement with McCloud was fair, reasonable and “in\\ngood faith” within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Contribution\\nAct.  740 ILCS 100/2(c).  Accordingly, summary judgment was granted\\nin favor of Booker.\\nBooker has now filed the instant Motion requesting the Court\\nto enter a partial final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the\\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  And, again, Defendants have\\nfailed to respond.\\nRule 54(b) permits a court to enter a partial final judgment\\n“when a distinct claim has been fully resolved with respect to all\\nparties[,]” and there is no just reason for delay.  Lottie v. West\\nAmerican Ins. Co., 408 F.3d 935, 938-39 (7th Cir. 2005)(quotations\\nomitted).  A claim is not distinct or separate if the claim “so\\noverlaps the claim or claims that have been retained for trial that\\nif the later were to give rise to a separate appeal at the end of\\nthe case the court would have to go over the same ground that it\\nhad covered in the first appeal.”  Id. at 939 (quoting Lawyers\\nTitle Ins. Corp. v. Dearborn Title Corp., 118 F.3d 1157, 1162 (7th\\nCir. 1997).  In other words, a claim is separate from the remaining\\nclaims if there is minimal factual overlap.  Id. \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 195    Page 3 of 3                                             \\n      \\nIn the present case, the underlying legal issue as to whether\\nthis Court correctly interpreted the Contribution Act when granting\\nsummary judgment in favor of Booker is separate and distinct from\\nthe remaining claims which allege that the accident in question\\nresulted from a defectively manufactured tire.  Thus, the appellate\\ncourt would not need “to go over the same ground” if Defendants’\\ncontribution claim is appealed now and the remaining claims are\\nappealed later.  As such, the Court finds that these claims have\\nminimal factual overlap and there is no just reason for delaying\\nthe entry of a partial final judgment.\\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Booker’s Motion for Entry of\\nFinal Judgment [Doc. # 98] is hereby GRANTED and the Clerk of the\\nCourt is expressly directed to enter a final judgment for Booker.\\nEntered this  11th  day of August, 2006\\n   /s/ Joe B.

In \\nparticular, McCloud argues that Exhibits 7 and 17 attached to her \\nMemorandum of Law and Evidence in Opposition to Defendants’ \\nMotion to Bar the Testimony of Derian, Woehrle and Kasner [Doc. \\n#170] are confidential documents which must be filed under seal \\npursuant to paragraph 9 of the Protective Order entered in this \\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 183    Page 2 of 3                                             \\n      \\ncase on July 27, 2005 [Doc. #71].  But, paragraph 9 clearly \\nstates as follows: \\nIf confidential documents are to be filed in \\nsupport of a motion, or used at trial, the parties \\nshall, before filing the documents or filing a motion \\nto seal the documents, make a good faith effort to \\nredact the confidential information in such a manner \\nthat the document still contains the information \\nrequired for the Court’s consideration. Only if \\nredaction is not possible may a party move for leave \\nto file the document under seal. The motion shall \\nexplain how the document(s) in question meet the \\nstandards for filing sealed documents as discussed in \\nCitizens First Nat’l Bank of Princeton v. Cincinnati \\nIns. Co., 178 F.3d 943 (7th Cir. 1999), and its \\nprogeny. \\nAny motion for leave to file documents under \\nseal, together with supporting information, shall be \\nsubmitted for an in camera review to the presiding \\njudge via email at the email addresses specified in \\nthe Central District’s Administrative Procedures for \\nFiling, Signing, and Verifying Pleadings and Papers by \\nelectronic Means in Civil Cases, § III. The pleading \\nor documents that the party wishes to be filed under \\nseal shall be attached as an Exhibit. \\n \\n[Doc. #71, ¶ 9] (emphases added). \\n \\nHere, McCloud has failed to follow any of the procedures \\noutlined above in paragraph 9 of the Protective Order.  \\nTherefore, at the present time, there is no justification for \\nplacing Exhibits 7 and 17 under seal.  McCloud, nevertheless, \\nwill be given 14 days from the date of this Order to comply in \\nfull with paragraph 9 of the Protective Order.  If McCloud fails \\nto comply with paragraph 9 within the allotted time frame, this \\nCourt will deny her Motion to File Documents Under Seal. \\n   \\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that McCloud will be given 14 days \\nfrom the date of this Order to comply in full with paragraph 9 of \\n \\n2\\n\\x0c\\n1:04-cv-01118-JBM-JAG   # 183    Page 3 of 3                                             \\n      \\nthe Protective Order [Doc. #71], or her Motion to File Documents \\nUnder Seal [Doc. #172] will be denied. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nEntered this  21st  day of June, 2006. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     /s/ Joe B.
